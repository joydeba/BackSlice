In python-3.8+, you can use the walrus operator: ``` return [stripped_pat for pat in patterns if (stripped_pat := pat.strip())] ``` That particular example might be a bit obfuscated, though.  I'm not sure if it's just the unfamiliarity of the walrus operator that makes it less readable or that it leads to too much going on in too little space.  Time will tell.::Yes, I did too many permutations and measurements to avoid the ""double stripping"" but didn't see any significant performance difference. I have seen the walrus operator a bit but don't fully get it yet. I have seen a few examples (like this one) that seem hard to fully understand. So I either have more reading to do, or the syntax is too dense/magic. As you said, time will tell. 😄 Thank you for the suggestion, though.::",556ee11b4363a09fbe8de4c5e6a2b656220bad1d::

Turns out that it was a different parameter, ```message``` which should never be used.  (pytest has deprecated message because the same issue affected many people https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#pytest-raises ) I recommend it when looking at this code because I notice that we're doing ```to_native(e)``` as if e was an exception object here.   It's actually a pytest container that holds the actual exception inside of it.  Getting the str representation of the pytest container seems to return the string representation of the exception for now but it's not documented in pytest so it might not work in the future.::heh :-)  I see that you found this out here: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/60246 ;-)::",797bf4a84c9e222296c0b9846c61b5b8ff24d787::
