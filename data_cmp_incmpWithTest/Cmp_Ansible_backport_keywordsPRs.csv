This was done via a `cat` multiline instruction, which is implemented internally by writing a temporary file to TMPDIR (/tmp in this case) first. Docker fails to provide /tmp just after creation, which results in a race condition that rarely makes the init fail. Changed the `cat` statement to multiple `echo`s.

Error message is now generated by missing_required_lib() to be in line with other modules. PR #51852 for whatever reason missed this. Until recently, PyPI was hosting a rather old version of XenAPI library. Module docs discouraged it's usage because of numerous bugs and incompatibility with some Python versions. Since XenAPI library on PyPI is now updated to latest version, module docs are updated to reflect that. Citrix decided to rebrand XenServer to Citrix Hypervisor. Some parts of the module docs are updated to reflect this so that new users are not confused. Rest of the docs and the code, and in fact module names, stil use XenServer name. At this moment, I'm not eager to change that.",2c6bb31a82d37ef6ba11ea6573c4cc68c2d4b1b2::

In python-3.8+, you can use the walrus operator: ``` return [stripped_pat for pat in patterns if (stripped_pat := pat.strip())] ``` That particular example might be a bit obfuscated, though.  I'm not sure if it's just the unfamiliarity of the walrus operator that makes it less readable or that it leads to too much going on in too little space.  Time will tell.::Yes, I did too many permutations and measurements to avoid the ""double stripping"" but didn't see any significant performance difference. I have seen the walrus operator a bit but don't fully get it yet. I have seen a few examples (like this one) that seem hard to fully understand. So I either have more reading to do, or the syntax is too dense/magic. As you said, time will tell. 😄 Thank you for the suggestion, though.::",556ee11b4363a09fbe8de4c5e6a2b656220bad1d::

Turns out that it was a different parameter, ```message``` which should never be used.  (pytest has deprecated message because the same issue affected many people https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#pytest-raises ) I recommend it when looking at this code because I notice that we're doing ```to_native(e)``` as if e was an exception object here.   It's actually a pytest container that holds the actual exception inside of it.  Getting the str representation of the pytest container seems to return the string representation of the exception for now but it's not documented in pytest so it might not work in the future.::heh :-)  I see that you found this out here: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/60246 ;-)::",797bf4a84c9e222296c0b9846c61b5b8ff24d787::

I'm not sure whether this really counts as a bugfix, or is more a feature request, since this adds a new curve. Since the original intend of elliptic curve support was to cover the most important curves, this one should have really been there in the first place. Mentioning secp256k1 instead of secp256r1 as most interoperable is definitely a bug: secp256r1 and secp384r1 are the only elliptic curves supported by almost all browsers (excluding too old ones), while secp256k1 usually isn't supported. (For example, both [Chrome 49](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewClient.html?name=Chrome&version=49&platform=XP%20SP3&key=136) and [IE11](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewClient.html?name=IE&version=11&platform=Win%207&key=143) only support these two curves, while [Firefox 47](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewClient.html?name=Firefox&version=47&platform=Win%207&key=132) and [Safari 7](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewClient.html?name=Safari&version=7&platform=iOS%207.1&key=63) additionally support secp521r1; search for ""named groups"" in the links for details. [Safari 10](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewClient.html?name=Safari&version=10&platform=OS%20X%2010.12&key=138) still supports no other groups, so even with more modern browsers one still is stuck with these two curves.) So I'd argue for this to be a bugfix.

But '--encrypt-vault-id' is not intended for 'edit' since the 'edit' should always reuse the vault secret that was used to decrypt the text. Change cli to not check for --encrypt-vault-id on 'edit'.

VaultEditor.edit_file() will now use 'vault_secret_used' as returned from decrypt_and_get_vault_id() so that an edited file always gets reencrypted with the same secret, regardless of any vault id configuration or cli options.
