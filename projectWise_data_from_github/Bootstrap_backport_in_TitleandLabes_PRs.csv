Turns out @XhmikosR didn't like that, so he opened #32250. Method is similar to the technique we use for the input/button groups. Because we now have an overlap, I needed a non-transparent color to prevent the colors from mixing. I still notice a little jump in Chrome (rendering issue in Chrome, macOS?), but I'm afraid that's out of our jurisdiction (tried some hacks with `will-change`, but without result). There's also still a little jump on the last item, but we also add an additional border. We could ""fix"" this by adjusting the bottom padding, but this could become problematic when the paddings are removed. Also, because in reality the accordion content won't always be exactly the same, chances are the total accordion height will vary when sections are collapsed.

Alongside that, this drops all support for multiple addons, dropdowns, button groups, and multiple inputs. Together, has the advantage of fixing our longstanding rounded corner issue with form validation. All those variations in the component make for an immense amount of difficulty in supporting it long term, and missing important bugs like the rounded corners with form validation. By simplifying things like this with two specific class names, we gain a ton of control. If you find yourself needing a layout that uses all these now dropped variations, a standard ""inline"" form layout is most likely the best option (more control over spacing, alignment, and responsive behaviors). Still more to be done, but I'm liking this simplified direction. This fixes #25110 and closes #30170. With the changes from #31677, this also fixes #28414.

For example: the block with shadow-sm on hover needs to be changed to shadow-lg ```html <div class=""shadow-sm""></div> ``` ```css .shadow-sm:hover { /* ??? He will repeat his own styles */ } ```::And it should look like this: ```html <div class=""shadow-sm shadow-lg-hover""></div> ``` or ```html <div class=""shadow-sm shadow-hover-lg""></div> ```::> Per my above comment, I think just `.shadow:hover` makes the most sense. Here we'd be allowing folks to opt-in to any state(s) for any classes. This confuses me a bit @mdo. This means adding the `shadow` class would only add a shadow on hover?::Hmm might have been a brain fart from me—for some reason I was thinking of these as adding to the existing utilities, but that's not right as y'all have mentioned. So, my apologies and carry on!::I would suggest generating with this pattern ``` .#{$pseudo}-#{$property-class + $infix + $property-class-modifier}:#{$pseudo} ``` This will separate the utility and its states. The user will be able to work faster with pseudo-classes. For instance: ``` .hover-shadow-sm .hover-text-primary .focus-border-info ``` etc::Problem with that is it breaks our conventions elsewhere. I think we'd have to do the state at the end. Thoughts @MartijnCuppens and @ffoodd?::@mdo Then I propose to leave it as it was.

Here's a rundown of what got us to today: - Shipped responsive containers in #29095 and #29118 w/ v4.4.0. - Added `min-width: 0` to `.col` to prevent some broken columns in #30049, which closed #25410. - Shipped #30979 to fix #30852, which reverted the above `min-width` change. - Shipped #30940 to fix #30840, which added `flex: 1 0 100%` to `.row`s so they didn't shrink if the parent was a flex container. This problem stemmed from v4.4.0 where navbar container was changed due to responsive containers. This caused #31432. - Shipped #30969 to de-dupe our container classes in our generated CSS, which also removed a mixin instead of deprecating it. This was a breaking change. We've already removed the `min-width: 0` in v4.5.1, so that's covered. The last step is to undo the `flex: 1 0 100%` on `.row`s and get us back to our stable grid in v4. This is causing the problem reported in #31435. Unsetting `flex` fixes the issue, so that's why this PR removes the line entirely. The workaround for the `<pre>` element in the columns is to add `min-width: 0` to help flex layout shrink past the content's size. This is documented at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36247140/why-dont-flex-items-shrink-past-content-size. There's also a demo of this in the CodePen below. #31438 restores the `make-container-max-widths` mixin, fixing our backward compatibility issue. Adding `.flex-fill` to the `.row` in our navbars fixes the issue with the row not taking up the full width of the parent container that has `display: flex`. This addresses #30840 properly. We could add custom styles to the navbar's rows, but that just sounds like it'd perpetuate the issue here.

Given that there are utilities for the *position* property, it seems logic to have utilities for the *top*, *left*, *bottom* and *right* propertires. I've also added some utilities to center the elements using *translations*. ### Arrange elements Arrange elements easily with the edge positioning utilities. The format is `{property}-{position}`.

I just was confused why you're still defining the plugin here since you removed it from the deps but I guess you are relying on preset-env to have the dep.. but after reading the [issue](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/31007#issuecomment-642398601), see `loose` removes the `typeof-symbol` plugin so it's not needed, and `object-rest-spread` is included.. However you can't pass every option down to each plugin specifically (only loose in this case). Apologies Babel is still so confusing! The difference in output is due to how plugins/presets are working so here's a long explanation. Plugins [run before](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#plugin-ordering) presets so in this case, it's running the object rest spread plugin without `loose` so it uses the `_objectSpread` helper function. `loose` makes it use the `_extends` helper which is an alias for `Object.assign`. And there's even another option `useBuiltIns` which simply replaces it for `Object.assign` if you can assume that it's polyfilled or supported. My recommendation is to use `loose` with [`object-rest-spread`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread#loose). Is there a reason you don't want ""babel is extending Object.assign.""? It would save more space due to less helpers being needed as you probably don't use it in a way that requires that spec behavior. Example from [CodeSandbox](https://50wce.csb.app/) I made for comparing configs: ![Screen Shot 2020-06-13 at 3 09 02 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588473/84572940-7e486100-ad6b-11ea-8884-7f87f8669129.png) ::@hzoo TBH I was just trying to make sure we do things the right way because we haven't touched this stuff for a long time :) > Is there a reason you don't want ""babel is extending Object.assign.""? I thought it would make more sense to go with the official way and not the Object.assign way. Other than that I'm not aware of any other reason. Do note that I didn't originally set this up myself. So, I'm open to suggestions how to make things the right way. If you think it makes sense to keep the plugin listed in devDependencies, I can revert that part. I'm in between myself since I prefer to list everything I need directly. On the other hand, I didn't even know that this was included in preset-env until I played with it. Thanks for the reply!::> we haven't touched this stuff for a long time :) > I thought it would make more sense to go with the official way and not the Object.assign way Totally understandable! I don't think the way people use Babel is thinking about it all the time, it's interesting figuring out how to correlate perf/size/convenience/spec. Looking at https://unpkg.com/browse/bootstrap@4.5.0/dist/js/bootstrap.js, it includes `_objectSpread2`, `ownKeys`, `_defineProperty` because of the spec version of object rest spread (which is fine) but looking at usage you aren't doing anything like using defineProperties (writeable/enumerable) or using getters/setters so the Object.assign version should be fine. But if we want to make sure it behaves the same that can be another test (or unit test would cover it?). ```js config = { ...Default, ...config } ``` > If you think it makes sense to keep the plugin listed in devDependencies This is more about how npm works (if it's not directly there it uses the one from somewhere else, so either should be ok. Also another thing is that if you are dropping IE, you can change the output via babel using targets but i'll write more in a bit::But yeah my recommendation is to do ([blog](https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0#babel-preset-env-s-bugfixes-option-11083-https-githubcom-babel-babel-pull-11083) for more context on `bugfixes` but it should be default in next major): ```js module.exports = { presets: [ [ '@babel/preset-env', { loose: true, bugfixes: true, modules: false, } ] ] } ``` so I would remove that plugin reference of `plugins: ['@babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread']` since it's fine to rely on the `loose` behavior in these simple cases?::Was checking out https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/ and I was looking at https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/.browserslistrc, and after some rabbit hole.. it seems like maybe Babel has a bug with parsing `Android >= 6` for some reason.. but it looks like Android >= 5 (https://github.com/kangax/compat-table/issues/801) uses Chrome on Android instead of android webview. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588473/84834044-8835c280-affe-11ea-85d8-29e6dcecfaa0.png) So looks like after 4.4.4, there are no more versions and it just matches mobile android (which follows Chrome's versioning)? So I would suggest changing the value to `android 81` or using `ChromeAndroid` or `and_chr` for [Chrome for Android](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#browsers) instead. This way Babel wouldn't run as many plugins and it would save a lot of bytes since IE is dropped::Sorry for the late reply @hzoo! I just spent a few hours today due to this :/ I will probably make a new issue because I can't figure this out. Basically, the moment I remove `Android` our BrowserStack tests fail on Edge. https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30986/commits IIRC the behavior is normal because after Android 6 (?) Android WebView is using Chrome behind the scenes. What I don't get is why babel doesn't transform the other things so that they still work on Edge. But maybe we are missing something else in our test configuration. Back to this PR, if you could PR against main what you think is the best that would be perfect :) Ideally, we should backport any cleanup on v4-dev too so that there isn't a big diff between the two branches, apart from the browsers we support. Thanks for the help! EDIT: another issue I hit was that `Edge >= 16.16299` doesn't include `Edge 16` for some reason. So currently on `main`, browserslist targets Edge 17::Ok that's very weird.. Android 6 shouldn't represent anything based on my research and Edge 16 is a relatively new version with support for es modules at least on the javascript side so it must be failing because of something else.. and it's odd Android somehow makes Edge/Mobile Safari fail (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/runs/788403787?check_suite_focus=true) when both of those are already defined in the browserslist.. with `TypeError: Function expected`, yeah would need to look into why::I went ahead with your suggestion, although I'd prefer it if you were the patch author :) It does save us a few bytes from the dist files, not sure if our unit tests cover the Object spread cases. @Johann-S  might have a better idea about it. This tackles the issue on `main`, for v4-dev I'd need to backport it and see if everything works well. About the Android issue, I'll make a new issue here to track it, and I already have a draft PR where I experiment with modernizing our browserslist config in #30986, but I hit the aforementioned issue, so I put back Android. Also I split some changes to #31124.

Block-level is lighter to output and faster to parse, but make it less obvious of what is important to ignore for RTL.

https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap,30872,master-fod-focus-visible::master,1,closed,accessibility::css::dependencies::feature::js::no-backport-to-v4::v5::,"This is a very rough first try to include and use [WICG's `:focus-visible` polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) in Bootstrap. Let me add some background. ## What [`:focus-visible` belong to CSS Selectors level 4 specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo). As per the spec: > The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class applies while an element matches the `:focus` pseudo-class and the user agent determines via heuristics that the focus should be made evident on the element. Thus it's a very helpful selector to massively enhance accessibility. I suggest you read [""`:focus-visible` and backwards compatibility""](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2018/03/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/) by @patrickhlauke for more explanation and even more background. ## Why First of all: it's an easy way to safely drop the (sometimes) ugly default `outline`s when activating things using a mouse. This PR, as-is, fixes #27163 and may help with #29875. For years, Bootstrap has been using `box-shadow` for focus states, which can lead to some confusion since there's also a `$enable-shadows` variable that may cause some focus style to not render appropriately. See #26802 for an example. But what's more promising here is that it'd allow us to **make focus styles stronger** and more obvious. It would allow us to increase contrasts on `:focus`, which had been requested a few times (#23329 and #29422). And I'm quite sure there's probably a few cases with our components where focus could be better. :) ## How There, I need some help from @twbs/js-review :D I added the dependency, but this definetly require some JS love to be included in the best possible way. For now, I roughly imported the file form the `node_modules`—which can't obviously stay this way. On the CSS side: 1. I added a global reset for default `outline`s: you can preview this in our docs navbar for example, which got the default `outline` until now. 2. This is using [the `[data-focus-visible-added]` attribute instead of the `.focus-visible` class since it's environment-proof](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible/issues/179). 3. And we'll be able to enhance focus everywhere, but that's another story :) FYI in Boosted we chose to use `2px` wide solid `outline`s, and a `transition` on `outline-offset` (which may vary, depending on the component). You can use keyboard to navigate through [Boosted website](https://boosted.orange.com/) to preview this. ## Sidenote @patrickhlauke mentionned in his post in 2018 the potential use of `@supports`—but it couldn't test for selector support at that time. Well, [it can now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports#selector) and [the support for, say, `@supports selector(:focus-visible)`](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-css_at-rules_supports_selector) is pretty much the same than [support for `:focus-visible`](https://caniuse.com/#search=focus-visible). So a future-proof, JS-free way to go might be using `@supports`—but it'd be much, much more verbose on the CSS side.That's not how it should be imported BTW :P::That's pretty much what I meant: > I added the dependency, but this definetly require some JS love to be included in the best possible way.

Instead, this can be accomplished through all utilities. Also removes thead-dark/thead-light modifiers for utilities. ### New border-color utils To support the utilities-driven approach for replacing `.table-dark`, I've added a few new `border-color` utilities. These are a subset of our available grays, but I do believe they provide an improved set of options without including all the grays (and thus duplicating `$gray-900` and `$dark` options). The new options have been added to the borders utilities docs page. ### New background-color utils To match the border utilities, I've added one tint lighter for two gray backgrounds (didn't add `$gray-100` as it's the same as `$light`). This way you can choose from additional gray backgrounds and still have a slight contrast in the border colors. Definitely interested in thoughts on this. ### Updated table docs This also obviously updates the examples in the tables docs to reflect the new dark table approach, but also clarifies how inheritance comes into play with the table styles and the table borders. It also adds a new multiple `<tbody>` example and tweaks a few other bits and pieces. https://deploy-preview-30342--twbs-bootstrap.netlify.com/docs/4.3/content/tables/ --- Closes #28480, fixes #27879, nullifies #30046, fixes #28160, and fixes #24529.It took a while before I noticed what was going on here, I was just screening the page without reading the intro text and thought padding was somehow added to the table.

I've been thinking about this for awhile now and one thing I'd like to better showcase is that Bootstrap is extremely customizable, starting with v5. A ""theming"" page within the `Getting started` section just doesn't feel right anymore. The content represents more than theming, and it's also not really a ""getting started"" subject. I swear I'm not making everything a top level nav group. This one feels more important to me with the level of customization we provide, the conversations in other communities around theming (looking at you, React), and the still thriving themes marketplaces out there (not just ours). Thoughts? What's missing from this section/subject? --- ### Summary of changes - Deleted the Theming page and expanded it unto an entire section called Customize - New Customize > Overview page exists just to summarize this section. - Sass page includes some updated headings, and adjusted content around Sass map modifications. - Options page doesn't add much new, but I have renamed two of the super long options to better match the others. - Color page moves theme colors to the top, combines the previous iteration of the All colors and Grays sections, and adds two swatches for white and black. --- ### After discussion todos Once I hear from folks, I'll get to work on the following: - [x] Redirects from old page - [x] Audit and rewrite content - [x] Fix broken options table - [x] Update lists of options - [x] Update Color page after #29348 merges ### New discussion todos after 3/1 - [ ] Rename the overview into an index? Make the index the default for each section with this - [ ] Components page likely needs to be moved to another page, or have it's contents changed—this feels more like an approach doc right now. - [ ] Add new section for extending via plain CSS? - [ ] Finish optimize page We use the utility API for this nowadays, so this this needs some rewording or another example.

This would need some tests and context, I guess. - mention various extractors too, to prevent users from struggling with basic configuration. - I think we can search for posts and references, this has probably been covered several times.::Could we mention how we minify things, here? Might it be valuable to explicit our build dependencies?::Would you be interested in a `@font-face` pattern here? I made it (at some point) in Boosted.

https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap,29451,scss-structure-idea::main,1,closed,css::no-backport-to-v4::v5::,"Spiking out an idea to bring some clarity to our Sass files, specifically around the growing number of variables, functions, and settings. This is meant to invite further conversation, and shouldn't be reviewed yet. ## Context My idea here is that there can be greater clarity around the layers of Sass code. We have a few features to how we build this project, including: - Several global settings (via `$enable-` variables) - An entire color system (soon to be expanding with #) - Layout and component settings (via our breakpoints, grid configuration, spacer ranges, etc) - And lastly, more typical variables for nearly every `property: value` pairing we want to support customization for Putting all that in `_variables.scss` makes for a conflated and potentially confusing file. ## Changes This PR stubs out at least two changes: - Adds a new `_colors.scss` file for our growing list of color variables - Adds a new `_settings.scss` file for our `$enable-` variables for global configuration I'm thinking our other configuration variables can go in `_settings.scss`) as well (e.g., breakpoints, grids, containers, spacers, escaped characters). The rest of our variables, including the additional Sass map here and there, can remain in the original file as they support our components. ## Minimizing requirements for other builds Our grid dist files currently bring in the entire Sass file, as mentioned in #29428. This fix would only require `_settings.scss`, `_functions.scss`, and `_mixins.scss`. This is a considerable reduction and more specific, while not overly complicated. ## Split it all? I've thought about this for a bit and believe we shouldn't split the variables files by every component. This makes our lives more difficult (looking across more files if variables are reusing other variables), and takes away the option of generating or reading from a single file (a la several customizers out there). --- Thoughts? Alternate ideas? Additional concerns? ## TODOs - [ ] Fix importsI think this should be moved back to the variables file?::",4b38cce9ef55ae1c3f92482fea47d34884fc851a::29b1a2e63191ed301f95553f6fef38f3106ef85c::

This PR is entirely aimed at providing additional variables, and not any more classes (save for perhaps light `background-color`s and `color`s in another PR). I truly wish we could generate the variables another way, but for now, this is a huge boost to customizability purely by color. - Dynamic variables aren't possible in Sass, so this manually adds nine variations of each color. - Adds two new functions to `shade` (lighten) and `tint` (darken) each color. - From there, this documents the changes with docs specific classes to help communicate that these classes aren't part of Bootstrap proper. /cc @twbs/css-review Preview: <https://deploy-preview-29348--twbs-bootstrap.netlify.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/#all-colors> This could be simplified with a `range`, ping me if I forget.::tint-color() should use white and shade-color() should use black. At least that's how it works in Less.::Could use something like this (colors listed explicit as ``$colors`` contains grays) ```scss @each $color in (""blue"", ""indigo"", ""purple"", ""pink"", ""red"", ""orange"", ""yellow"", ""green"", ""teal"", ""cyan"") { @for $i from 1 through 9 { .bd-#{$color}-#{$i * 100} { color: color-yiq(#{#{$color}-#{$i * 100}}); background-color: #{#{$color}-#{$i * 100}}; } } } ``` Edit: Fixed missing variable ;-)::I don't think this 'll work. But if it does, could you provide a demo?::You're right ... I dunno how, but while writing this I must have imagined it working at some point :blush: Sorry for that! Only posibility I'd see is to use a map instead of plain variables. That drops overridability of the single shades and tints. On the other hand I'm asking myself how often people really would want to change a single color variant when using these shades & tints, so they could just override the whole map. Actually working example: ```scss @function shades-and-tints($colors: map-remove($colors, ""white"", ""gray"", ""gray-dark"")) { $shadesAndTints: (); @each $name, $color in $colors { $shadesAndTints: map-merge( ( ""#{$name}"": ( ""100"": tint-color($color, 8), ""200"": tint-color($color, 6), ""300"": tint-color($color, 4), ""400"": tint-color($color, 2), ""500"": $color, ""600"": shade-color($color, 2), ""700"": shade-color($color, 4), ""800"": shade-color($color, 6), ""900"": shade-color($color, 8) ) ), $shadesAndTints ); } @return $shadesAndTints; } $colorVariants: shades-and-tints() !default; @each $colorName, $variants in $colorVariants { @each $variant, $colorValue in $variants { .bd-#{$colorName}-#{$variant} { background-color: #{$colorValue}; color: color-yiq($colorValue); } } } ``` Edit: Exclude non-sense colors by default.::```suggestion All colors available in Bootstrap 5, are available as Sass variables and a Sass map in `scss/_variables.scss` file.

I've had a chance to play with this with @xhmikosr over the last couple weeks and it's been fun. We still have some work to do to bring it all up to speed and get this integrated with v4, but this PR adds Actions CI for Bootstrap 5. Here's what's changed: - Adds new `.github/workflows/test.yml`. - Actions CI runs on three versions of Node like our current Travis build. It's triggered on `push` and `pull_request`, so this covers us maintainers and forks I believe. - Separate from this PR, I've also created the new secrets in our repo settings. - Adds an unofficial badge to the project readme (official ones are coming I think), - Removed the `.travis.yml` file.

If `true`, the expression is returned with wrapped by `calc`, but if `false`, the expression is not wrapped with `calc`. The default is `true`. This option is intended for use in complex nested expressions: e.g. ```scss div { padding: add(1rem, add(1em, 1px));         // calc(1rem + calc(1em + 1px)) : invalid in IE padding: add(1rem, add(1em, 1px, false));  // calc(1rem + 1em + 1px) : valid in IE } ``` * [x] add calc() to stylelint function-blacklistThis test is redundant, it's covered by the following 2 tests.::I guess only `comparable()` is good enough here::The `type-of($value1) == number and type-of($value2) == number` is necessary to pass nested cases such as: ```scss .el { padding: add($rem, add($rem, $px)); padding: add($rem, add($rem, $px, false)); } ``` If the condition is missing, a compile error will occur: ``` argument `$number-2` of `comparable($number-1, $number-2)` must be a number ... ```::Which function is that we have blacklisted that we need to ignore?::```suggestion ## Add and Subtract functions ```::```suggestion We use the `add` and `subtract` functions to wrap the CSS `calc` function.

We had this problem: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/28691, which could be fixed by adding `!important` to all properties, but that would just make this problem bigger: https://codepen.io/MartijnCuppens/pen/Pgrpwe.

https://api.github.com/repos/twbs/bootstrap,25103,modal-footer-fix::master,0,merged,backport-to-v4::css::v4::v5::,"Fixes #24800. This is a no-go for me—we avoid universal selectors like this whenever possible.::@mdo Why?::Hi @MartijnCuppens this PR explains it #25165::I understand that we should use classes as much as possible. But in this case you don't know which elements are going to be placed in the `.modal-footer`. Also right now the following code is used to place margins between the elements: ``` css // Easily place margin between footer elements > :not(:first-child) { margin-left: .25rem; } > :not(:last-child) { margin-right: .25rem; } ``` Imo this isn't more dogmatic as the use of the universal selector.::Oh word, hmm. Those are also universal selectors since they'll match every elements first before limiting to last/first children. Both are bad generally speaking because they take much longer for browsers to parse and apply. I wonder if a mix of these existing styles and a `.modal-footer-item` would work? Or perhaps we just recommend spacing utils? A single universe selector is better than two though, too. Hmm...::With spacing utils, there are some responsive issues (spacing between wrapped elements). Providing the `.modal-footer-item` class would be the best solution if we want to prevent the use of the universal selector. Downside: It **must** be added to all children of the `.modal-footer` and that would break all existing implementations of the modal.::@mdo Have you made your mind up about this?::",30e91ca6b534cc023050f63225b6582249cef059::cc0e9fabd4ad9428aae5d3b366412aa2f59b5064::
