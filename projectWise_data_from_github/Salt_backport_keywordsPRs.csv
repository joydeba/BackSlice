Feature request closes #57639 This PR makes [memory tuning](https://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsMemoryTuning) option available which allow much greater control of memory allocation. configurable parameters are: -  `hard_limit` - `soft_limit` - `swap_hard_limit` - `min_guarantee` In addition,  `_handle_unit` function is added which uses regex to parse user input into the corresponding size. Fixes a bug on adding sub element to existing XML tree.  `Element.append()` should be used to append an element into existing XML tree.  When using `ElementTree.SubElement()` we must make sure the parent element is from the target domain XML tree. Refactored XML diff code, added a few helper functions to manipulate xml node. More robust check is added  `if 'initrd' in boot and boot.initrd` to ensure `None` object will not cause an exception if it is passed to initialise a new VM . ### Merge requirements satisfied? **[NOTICE] Bug fixes or features added to Salt require tests.** <!-- Please review the [test documentation](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/master/topics/tutorials/writing_tests.html) for details on how to implement tests into Salt's test suite. --> - [x] Docs - [x] Changelog - https://docs.saltstack.com/en/master/topics/development/changelog.html - [x] Tests written/updated ### Commits signed with GPG?

(From #51973) The virtual module 'pkg' is heavily used by other states, like the 'pkg' state, so differences in the signature of public functions can generate errors like: TypeError: xxx() got an unexpected keyword argument 'yyy' The fix is to add the parameter 'yyy' into all versions of the function 'xxx()' in all the 'pkg' virtual modules, but this approach is cumbersome and not very resilient, as any refactoring on the public interface or in the pkg state module will break again the already agreed contract. This patch append **kwarg in most of the public methods on virtual module pkg where it is missing, fixing the described issue and making more easy the refactoring of the code. Also do the same for 'lowpkg' (From #52412) In the openSUSE family we have several kind of packages, like patterns, patches and products. Currently we can use the `pkg` state and the `pkg` module to install them, but as they are not listed under any `rpm` command, the module and the state will report a Fail. This patch updates the zypperpkg `list_pkgs` to explicitly include this kind of objects under the list, so the rest of the commands from the same execution module (install, update, etc) will report the correct restul at the end. Because the way that the `installed` state from `pkg` is designed, we cannot be implicit about the kind of objects that we are installing, so we need to indicate in the SLS that at least one object is a pattern or a patch: ```yaml example: pkg.installed: - name: pattern:SUSE-MicroOS - includes: [pattern] ``` The `includes` parameter will be passed to the `list_pkgs` from the zypper execution module, that will return the package list using RPM (for packages) and zypper (for patterns). This more complete report will be used in `pkg.installed` to identify the correct installation of the new object. Closes #52402 (From #52744) Some patters are non-visible, and cannot be detected via zypper se -t pattern unless we know the name. When we are listing all installed patterns, we still do not know the names of the patterns, so we need to use a different approach. This patch use `rpm -q --provides --whatprovides` search to detect the non-visible patters, and complete the result for `list_installed_patterns`. (From #52844) The `rpm -q --provides --whatprovides 'pattern()' command return error code 1 when any pattern is present. This patch ignore the return error code, as a not found pattern is not an error. (From #54024) The cache from pkg.list_pkgs for the zypper installer is too aggresive. Some parameters will deliver different package lists, like root and includes. The current cache do not take those parameters into consideration, so the next time that this function is called, the last list of packages will be returned, without checking if the current parameters match the old one. This patch create a different cache key for each parameter combination, so the cached data will be separated too. (From #54379) When a patch is installed via advisory_ids, we do not want to change the behavior of list_pkgs, via the includes field. Currently, if a patch is installed via advisory_ids (state pkg.patch_installed), it will call zypperpkg.install with this parameter inside kwargs. This parameter is parsed by pkg_resource.parse_targets, and the prefix `patch:` will be added very early, just before taking the list of the current packages. This last step will change the behavior of list_pkgs, as all the other patches will be listed. This sound OK except when we want to maintain the old behavior, when patches are not listed in the `install` function by default. This patch will add the `patch:` prefix in the list of targets later, once we have the list of packages, restoring the old behavior. Note that we can still install a patch as a normal package, if we add the prefix in the name before calling `install`, and we do not use the `advisory_ids` field. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference?

No, current one should be OK (cherry picked from commit 5828aa1730022ce7d46a53507dade94dde44fa67) do we really want this new parameter? What about using fs_type for fat, as in fat12, 16, 32?::We do need it, as mkfs is a frontend for the specific executable mkfs.fs_type. There is not mkfs.fat12, mkfs.fat16 nor mkfs.fat32 executables, only mkfs.fat of mkfs.vfat. They use the -F parameter to indicate the size.::I think it's a wrong route to take, adding each different specific mkfs parameters here. The point of this function is to unify those calls, so probably we should have an abstraction parameter for this, where on ext to mean inode_size and on fat/vfat to mean fat-size. I'm not saying to reuse this particular inode_size, but to avoid adding new parameters for very specific calls. At worst, we should call it fat-size, as their man page describe it - https://linux.die.net/man/8/mkfs.vfat::The code is living in develop, this is a closed backport (so not accepted in this branch). I also note that the salt approach here is always to add explicit variables, with documentation in it. I do not recall any reuse of one variable for multiple purposes in any of the public API for salt. Can be the case tho that there is an instance of it, but any usage of kwargs was deeply reviewed. For the rename, I can agree with you. `fat_size` is more explicit. Feel free to create a PR to develop where this change is living.::",2198c9154a46c5ad7c189dcbfccabc8c2d84a14c::

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,51063,develop::develop,0,closed,,"Or, SaltStack is Python 3 only! - Feature Name: Sunset Legacy Python 2 Support - Start Date: 2019-01-04 - RFC PR: (leave this empty) - Salt Issue: (leave this empty) # Summary [summary]: #summary SaltStack is phasing out Python 2 support, with the develop branch of Salt Open dropping Python 2 support effective immediately. We will continue our policy of backporting bug fixes and security patches for the last two releases, but starting with release Neon we will no longer support legacy Python versions. For SaltStack, this means we will support &gt;=Python 3.6. Previous versions of SaltStack, that are able to run on legacy versions of Python will continue to be available on http://repo.saltstack.com as well as https://pypi.org. Older platforms without native Python 3 packages (e.g. RedHat) will be provided SaltStack packages that include Python 3. SaltStack will also fully support the creation of new, Python 3 based packages for all supported platforms. # Motivation [motivation]: #motivation ## Python 2 EOL Python 2 will no longer be [officially supported][1] as of [January 1, 2020][2]. As an organization, we cannot in good faith continue supporting Python 2 - any lingering bugs in unsupported Python versions could cause problems with SaltStack, and thus, our users. ## Python 3 ### New Features! By eliminating Python 2 support, it means we will be able to take advantage of modern Python features, like async/await, async generators, and asyncio (or other async frameworks). Additionally, all improvements to the Python language (speed, additional features, etc.) will come to Python 3. By dropping Python 2 support, SaltStack users will benefit from these improvements simply by keeping their Python installation up-to-date. ### Simplify In addition to the performance benefits, the modern Python features should allow us to simplify our codebase. As SaltStack internally supports Python 3 already, this simplification includes the ability to eliminate our dependency on [six][3]. Additionally, but having only Python 3 to support, we significantly decrease the time it takes to run our tests (having only one version of the language to run tests against). It also reduces the mental overhead of having to consider multiple Python versions when writing code. ### Python 3 Minimum Version In order to take advantage of the new features in Python 3, SaltStack's baseline version of Python will be Python 3.6. ### Availability In the past, native Python 3 packages were difficult to find - one usually needed to compile it themselves. That has changed now with all modern OSes shipping Python 3. ## Alternatives [alternatives]: #alternatives For those who are stuck with Python 2: - Previous versions of SaltStack, with Python 2 support, will continue to be available on http://repo.saltstack.com, as well as https://pypi.org - Enterprise SaltStack customers will be able to make special arrangements to continue to receive Python 2 support for certain platforms. If SaltStack continues to bridge Python 2 and 3 we will continue to incur the significant costs associated with maintaining and testing the combined codebase. We will also suffer the opportunity cost of not being able to take advantage of the more modern features being introduced with new Python 3 versions. # Drawbacks [drawbacks]: #drawbacks By dropping support for Python 2 it's possible that a significant number of installations may be impacted. For those who have custom modules that are Python 2 only, or are stuck on unsupported legacy patforms, they may not be able to upgrade to the newer versions of Salt. While this change won't break communication between master and minion, or change pillars or state files in any way, when SaltStack begins taking advantage of new Python language features (e.g.  async/await keywords, f-strings), it will effectively be broken for those who for whatever reason have not upgraded to modern platforms. However, in some cases, this change may be tipping point that gives them the impetus to upgrade to a more modern OS. # Thank You, Python 2 It wouldn't be right to drop support Python 2 without first saying a hearty, ""Thank you!"" Python 2 was a wonderful language to program in, and has brought us all much joy and success. Though newer versions of SaltStack will no longer run on Python 2, we will all have fond memories of the improvements it made in our life, and the improvements it allowed us to make in the lives of those around us. Python 2, so long, and thanks for all the fish!

Can they be documented? If not, can this be removed entirely? ::Hrm.  It seems to be there on most modern-ish python installs but I see your point.  Ideally we'd add it to the salt.ext bundle, since it's just crazy useful in general, but until that happens I can pretty easily translate the several jmespath calls I make to `xxx.get('foo', {}).get('bar', '')` type calls instead :)  That's what they originally were in my code before I transmuted the to jmespath calls anyway...::@cachedout  Considering that ALL the AWS API talks is JSON back and forth, having a lightweight but super convenient library on hand to easily dig around inside that JSON payload (rather than the clumsy .get().get().get() style used so often, or even worse, unsafe assumptions like foo['bar'][0]['baz']) would be a HUGE win for everyone writing boto based modules, and provide a standard approach to such things as well... How would I go about asking for jmespath to be added to the salt.ext module exactly?  :)::We'd have to take our case to @thatch45, @twangboy  and @dmurphy18 and see what they think. The biggest issue here is packaging, which is a pretty major pain. We'd much rather see this as an optional dependency but let's see what the feedback looks like.::I can definitely make it optional, but that just ends up with two code-paths inside each function - one using JMESPath, and one using raw python (generally something on the order of `xxx.get('foo', {}).get('bar', {})[0].get('baz')` or such crappiness.  If we're going to have to put the latter into each function anyway, there's zero advantage to having the alternate JMESPath version to begin with :) Fingers crossed ...::@cachedout It is generally available, e.g. Redhat extras repo, so so long as expect extras to be available, then updating salt requires should be easy enough. Question is would this be from Neon forward, or backport to Fluorine ?::I have no particular need to backport it right this moment, since I already have JMESPath installed on my salt masters (due to the other modules such as boto_rds which require it).  That said, there ARE the several modules mentioned below which already use it, so if nothing else, adding it to the requires for Fluorine would help allay any confusion which might otherwise arise if someone happened to be missing it, but tried out those modules :)::@cachedout the jmespath module installed cleanly on Windows when I just tried it.

When a minion lacks its minion_id at startup, salt.config.\_\_init\_\_.py requests one from utils.network.generate_minion_id(), which returns the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host. When all minions are within one domain and named after their hostnames, generated a ""FQDN minion id"" would be an inconsistent naming. salt.config.\_\_init\_\_.py has the option to lowercase the minion_id. salt.config.\_\_init\_\_.py also has the option to append a domain to a generated ""hostname minion id"".

Also, if you would just ask `if rem_domain:` then you get back a Boolean, and if it is True, still don't know what to do: remove specific domain, or any. Hence in these kind of situation we always explicitly looking for both type and value at the same time: `is None`, `is not None`, `is True` etc. Hope it helps. :wink: ::Maybe rephrase this by just plain English, something like: > When `minion_id_remove_domain` is set to `foo.org`, then only this domain will be removed from the minion ID. For example, `king_bob.foo.org` will be `king_bob` and `king_bob.bar.org` will remain unchanged. In case `minion_id_remove_domain` is set to `True`, then all domains will be removed.

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,48879,napalm-formula::develop,0,merged,ZRELEASED - Fluorine::,"### What does this PR do? Some time ago I started preparing some formulas for network configuration management with respect to the OpenConfig standards. The repositories are created, part of the formulas are available, e.g, https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/napalm-ntp-formula Generally, all these formulas (unfortunately) only generate a text blob that is eventually loaded on the device. Therefore the formulas will 90% be some Jinja template with a considerable size. To shrink this size, and make it more human readable, I thought about having a module, that transforms blocks such as: ```jinja {%- if subif_cfg.config.get('description') %} description {{ subif_cfg.config.description }}; {%- endif %} ``` Into a more simplified (when reading, at least): ```jinja {{ salt.napalm_formula.render_field(subif_cfg.config, 'description') }} ``` With the same rendering result: ``` description ""Some description""; ``` Which does all these repetitive checks such as above, which would appear tens of times in a template. Besides, it also add the field name. This module is generic enough, and it will be used by all the future NAPALM Formulas, e.g., https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/napalm-bgp-formula, https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/napalm-interfaces-formula etc. Together with this, adding some more little helpers for various manipulation of the OpenConfig-like Python objects.Since this code is going into develop, there is no need to do this try/except, since the function lives in `salt.utils.data` now. Not only that, there are three problems with this approach: 1. Importing a function into the module's global scope will add it to the `__salt__` dunder (i.e. `__salt__['napalm_formula.traverse_dict_and_list']`) 2. This will also add this function to the docs, which will be confusing. 3. Since we have compatibility functions in `salt.utils` for all the funcs that were moved for 2018.3, the first import will succeed and this will result in deprecation warnings. Instead, you should simply `import salt.utils.data` and invoke the function with its full name.::When possible, it would be great to also use `__utils__['data.traverse_dict_list']()` because then it will allow people to include that data.py file in their `salt://_utils/` directory if they are unable to upgrade to the newer version of salt.::Doing it @gtmanfred's way will also prevent you from needing to import the module at all.::Thanks guys for reviewing this and your thoughts. As Daniel mentioned, I made these imports having backwards potability in mind; using `__utils__` sounds like a better idea, thought it would require backporting loads of util modules. Re 2: Indeed, I thought about that too, but it seems like Sphinx is smart enough not to pick these functions (no idea why) and they don't appear in the documentation (tested with both Salt and our internal documentation). Anyway, I will change to use `__utils__` as it seems a better tradeoff.::Updated, though I just wanted to point this out: porting `utils.data` means it also requires porting `utils.dictupdate`, `utils.stringutils`, and `utils.yaml` (as they are imported there). This is fine, though when I need, e.g., `files.fopen`, or `args.clean_kwargs`, I would also need to port loads of others such as `utils.jid`, `utils.path`, `utils.platform`, `utils.data`... and here's the catch: `salt.utils.args` needs `salt.utils.data` - see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/utils/args.py#L18 (which obviously won't be available). So not only that one basically needs to port almost all the modules under `utils/` but also they need to be patched (i.e., replace imports like the one from `utils.args` from `import salt.utils.data` to `import _utils.data` plus updating all the code to use the new import. This sounds like a nightmare to me. Looking at this vs. 1 & 3 I'm not sure which is the worst...::What about the following: ```python from salt.version import __version_info__ if __version_info__ < (2018, 3): from salt.utils import traverse_dict_and_list as _traverse_dict_and_list else: from salt.utils.data import traverse_dict_and_list as _traverse_dict_and_list ``` Or why not, even simpler: ```python try: from salt.utils.data import traverse_dict_and_list as _traverse_dict_and_list except ImportError: from salt.utils import traverse_dict_and_list as _traverse_dict_and_list ``` This way we can ensure that the function won't be exported (note that I flipped the import order to prevent deprecation warning thrown on >= Oxygen, i.e., it will firstly try to use from `salt.utils.data`). Does this sound like a better alternative?::This does seem like a better alternative. ```python try: from salt.utils.data import traverse_dict_and_list as _traverse_dict_and_list except ImportError: from salt.utils import traverse_dict_and_list as _traverse_dict_and_list ``` However, I'm not sure why this should be necessary at all in `develop`.::Yes, the question just comes down to, ""How friendly to we want to be for allowing people to backport these modules?""::Added https://github.com/saltstack/salt/pull/48879/commits/3e9ccdb397ba4fea30c97dba2084b91e44db7287 - please let me know if this is okay for the time being.::",e75f285d91025f40e485e7c6907323381322cea1::25d83b209045913438fc702eefc43b737abe394f::ddf8126958f2b819bc47b546693aaab8d26ca8de::ef2c817025934001500f158926de2d47c3326784::3e9ccdb397ba4fea30c97dba2084b91e44db7287::
https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,48178,fixup-presence::develop,0,merged,,"### What does this PR do? This teaches salt.utils.minions.CkMinions.connected_ids() about IPv6, so that IPv6 minions show up in the manage.list_state and family runners, as well as presence events, when the master runs on a system with /proc/net/tcp{,6}. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? While I was in this section of code, I fixed some logic issues around including any localhost minion (including IPv6 localhost minion), while avoiding including any minion that isn't connected.  This allows any localhost minion to always show up in presence events. I also fixed salt.utils.network.local_port_tcp() and salt.utils.network.active_tcp() so they don't include listening ports when /proc/net/tcp is available, to match their OS-specific implementations, and made it so IPv6 connections don't overwrite IPv4 connections in active_tcp() results. ### Previous Behavior IPv6 minions don't show up in manage.list_state and family runner results or presence events on masters with /proc/net/tcp{,6}.  salt.utils.network.local_port_tcp() and salt.utils.network.active_tcp() include listening ports when /proc/net/tcp{,6} is available.  salt.utils.network.active_tcp() is missing some IPv4 connections when there are IPv6 connections. ### New Behavior IPv6 minions are included in manage.list_state and family runner results and presence events on masters with /proc/net/tcp{,6}.  salt.utils.network.local_port_tcp() and salt.utils.network.active_tcp() don't include listening ports when /proc/net/tcp{,6} is available.  salt.utils.network.active_tcp() includes all IPv4 and IPv6 connections. ### Tests written? No ### Commits signed with GPG? Yes ### Miscellaneous notes I opened this PR against develop because I changed the API of CkMinions.connected_ids() as the include_localhost parameter was no longer needed.  I would like to see this backported to at least 2018.3, though, and preferably make it in before 2018.3.2 is released, so I don't have to continue to apply this fix locally.  If changing the API of this function in a stable release is an issue, then the function could still accept the parameter but just not do anything with it. I'm still not happy with how CkMinions.connected_ids() is implemented, because there's one presumably common case and a few edge cases that are not handled: * NATed minions won't be listed (presumably common case) * If there are multiple minions with the same IP address, they will all be listed if at least one is connected from that address * If there are multiple masters listening on the same port but different addresses, minions can be listed that aren't connected to the master being interrogated * (possibly Linux-specific) If a localhost minion connects to the master using an address in 127.0.0.0/8 that either is not explicitly configured on the loopback interface or the master is not explicitly listening on, it won't be listed Fixing any of these would require a lot more work.This is request to show IPv4, and still you putting IPv6. I guess, this parameter needs either be renamed to ""show_ip"" (preferred) or we need to add another one (no idea why). In fact, this parameter/option is only used once, in `manage` runner, `list_state` function. So we've still got room and time to improve this.::This change will need to go through a deprecation process. https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/deprecations.html::Where you have show_ipv4, and show_ip for 2 releases, and then it can be removed.::",81aa846474e034fe214b6f1c985cf1b6823cd1e2::e5fea23eabc2a1b917f299497114067b46ab2f04::abe70397df6787385f69c661baf3ebeb359ceb04::bd9f1e7634f37e31ad921f7118b453a7778be536::aa1e4152db3996494e32bf0d9824feb6c4c4c155::46ba5e9275e6854875cf6ce60c343e534d430445::532ec894add1ef8cd34ef8ce294c2c2367df2fdc::c3650eed03f28ab9cac2e08dac24a7eefbb1e7e0::

National Instruments used to have a custom set of commits in-house, for the older Linux RT distribution, but it makes more sense to upstream that too and expand salt's support. In order to do that, we have to differentiate between those two platforms, and we do that now through this 'lsb_distrib_id' grain. It also clean up the nilrt-xfce distribution that was never a distribution. ### Previous Behavior grains['lsb_distrib_id'] was always showing 'nilrt' previously and it was some custom code that differentiate between older distribution and the new distribution of Linux RT. That had to be spread around multiple modules that needed that logic. ### New Behavior Modules can use the grains['lsb_distrib_id'] info to differentiate between newer vs. older linux distribution for National Instruments Linux RT platform For the older distribution is showing 'nilrt', as for the newer distribution 'nilrt-nxg'. ### Tests written?

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,47337,runtests-subset::develop,0,merged,Has Testcase::code-jam::has master-port::,"This adds two new options to runtests.py's option parser: - `--from-filenames` - A comma-separated list of filenames. runtests.py will then attempt to match test modules in both the unit and integration suites, by filename (e.g. `salt/modules/git.py` would result in `unit.modules.test_git` and `integration.modules.test_git` being run. - `--filename-map` - A supplemental YAML file which can be used to map file globs to test modules, allowing us to make sure that changes in a pkg module cause the pkg/pkgrepo state tests to be run (for example). Each glob will be `fnmatch.filter`'ed against the list of files, and if a match is found, the targeted list of test modules will be run. Right now, the initial `tests/filename_map.yml` only contains one glob, I need to add more and would like some input on what should be added.Why does this particular `utils` import need to be separated out in a try/except, but not the other imports above that have full `salt.utils.x` paths?::This is because the function location is different on 2017.7 due to the `salt.utils` re-organization. So the `except` below will try to import from the 2017.7-and-earlier location. The `as` is used so that irrespective of Salt version, we use the same name to invoke expr_match.::@terminalmage Right, but you have files above that are not in a try/except block that were also moved around during the `salt.utils` changes. My thought is that either all of those imports should be moved into a try/except, or none should.::Ahh yeah, I added those other imports later after initially doing it that way for expr_match.  I removed the try/except. We'll either have to backport separately for 2017.7 and 2018.3 or not backport past 2018.3.::possibly add `integration.modules.test_useradd` and `unit.modules.test_useradd`? and also on the other tests below it seems we are not clarifying the `integration/unit.module` tests equivalents as well. is this on purpose?::Yes, this is all on purpose. runtests.py will automagically match files that match a naming convention. Otherwise, the map file would be thousands of lines long and would be a pain in the butt to maintain. So, there is no need to add `integration.modules.test_useradd` and `unit.modules.test_useradd` as they would be picked up when `salt/modules/useradd.py` is specified in the `--from-filenames` parameter.::So, I presume that the workflow for adding tests would change so that this file should be modified when appropriate when new tests are added?

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,45941,issue45679::oxygen.rc1,0,merged,,"The logic which ensures that we expose ports which are being bound, even when not explicitly configured, was done incorrectly. UDP ports were being passed to the API as '1234/udp' instead of (1234, 'udp'). This results in the port not being exposed properly. The logic has been corrected. Additionally both the ""ports"" input translation function, as well as the post-processing code (where the port numbers configured in port_bindings were being added) both contained code to ""fix"" any ports which were configured using 'portnum/tcp', as these must be passed to the API simply as integers. To reduce code duplication, this normalization is now only performed at the very end of the post-processing function, after ports have been translated, and any missing ports from the port_bindings have been added. The unit test for the port_bindings input translation code, which was written based upon the same incorrect reading of the API docs that resulted in the incorrect behavior, have been updated to confirm the (now) correct behavior. The unit test for the ports input translation code has been updated to reflect the new normalization behavior. Finally, an integration test has been added to ensure that we properly expose UDP ports which are added as part of the post-processing function.

It adds a new optional parameter to `list_pkg` in the `zypper` module to return more data than the version (original reason is that for SUSE Manager integration we also need `arch` and `install_date`).

None known. ### New Behavior If the new parameter `attr` is specified, more package attributes are returned. ### Tests written? Yes - existing tests have been adapted and a new one has been added. ### Other notes If this PR is accepted we will likely open others to get more attributes, add the same capabilities to the `yumpkg` module and backport this code at least to 2016.11.

I can of course change this if requested by the Salt team.::> I suggest you supply all information by default. I disagree here. Reason is that the returned data has a different structure when the `attr` parameter is set, so any third party application or script must be ready to accept it. That means that putting the `attr` parameter as a default will make `zypper` return something different from all other backends that must be treated in a special way by default, and will break backwards compatibility. This is not really the intention here - what I would like to see is an option to return more data only if the requester needs it, only if it is prepared to handle it.::Fixed in 04a1bbbc48ada0c587c67af76944779f0d325863, thanks!::@damon-atkins the `attr=None` is what `lowpkg.info attr=...` does. Nothing to do here with the ""standard signatures"". @moio yep. :+1: ::I agree with @isbm and @moio here but I'll give @damon-atkins a chance to reply before we move forward with this. Thanks.::nix.py is new in development ``` :param bool attributes: show the attributes of the packages when listing all packages. Default: True ``` Which standard is going to be used attributes=True/False  or attrib=[list of attributes]? If its attrib=[list of attributes] then I suggest nix.py should be changed. At the end of the day their needs to be common parameters which perform the same thing.  Making salt easier to learn and (mostly) consistent across platforms. Should be able to sit at the command prompt salt * pkg.list_pkgs  param=value And platforms which do not support param ignore it and platforms which support param do all the same thing.  The attributes return should have the same meaning across platforms. Unfortunately and overall/platform wide  doco for pkg.list_pkgs for example does not exist. So it means developers need to look at all of pkg modules to try and determine consistence approach before coding. Something like `attrib` (common) and `attrib_all`  this would be attributes which are not common across platforms, like the win_*.  Should platform specific attributes be prefixed? This topic comes up now and then with regards to pkg modules api. Last time, a Salt Team member change it to (x=default,y=default) and then after discussion, the Salt Team changed it back to using kwargs so its more compatible with other platforms. Configuration Management Tools should mostly remove the platform specific differences so their is common approach across platforms.::> nix.py is new in development ... > Which standard is going to be used attributes=True/False or attrib=[list of attributes]? This seems to me like a valid but different concern than the two discussed above (what the default behaviour should be and whether the new parameter should be in `**kwargs`). I am now restricting the discussion to this last topic. The choice of the `attr` name and its format here was taken mainly to stay coherent with the existing [info_installed](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/all/salt.modules.zypper.html#salt.modules.zypper.info_installed) - lacking a broader overview I am open to change that if the Salt team indicates to do so. ::@damon-atkins since the topic is not about ""standard signature"" anymore, I see very little difference here: ```python >>> def foo(a=None, **kw): print a, kw >>> foo(**{'a':'Foo', 'b':'bar'}) Foo {'b': 'bar'} >>> foo(a='Foo', b='bar') Foo {'b': 'bar'} >>> foo(b='bar') None {'b': 'bar'} >>> >>> def foo(**kw): print 'a' in kw and kw.pop('a') or None, kw >>> foo(a='Foo', b='bar') Foo {'b': 'bar'} >>> foo(**{'a':'Foo', 'b':'bar'}) Foo {'b': 'bar'} >>> foo(b='bar') None {'b': 'bar'} ``` The only why one would have `attr` inside the `kwargs` is that the code itself takes care of it, or just passes elsewhere, like in case of `info_installed`. I see a very little merit discussing all that.::",470ba57418943670aa8137d43de32e1bc9d649aa::c2210d64ab2c3d8b1355ef88e20d42b919b2debd::a32ee4af0550ac0acf3bae53fee983496c282b4a::bb049cb70f91c95bf465817ba8620acdddb62815::db22777a09820e29e921b3ae5391f47ba51d396a::5e23f5d67844e43f9673d8b2836523e9bb25cec0::d609ed2eeed1900b909d1d1060e258415fcd2b2c::8a631d18df1a9ba100864f16f3766bc22f9b7fae::

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,39948,thread-safe-loader::develop,0,closed,,"### What does this PR do? There was a race condition in the salt loader when injecting global values (e.g. ""__pillar__"" or ""__salt__"") into modules. One effect of this race condition was that in a setup with multiple threads, some threads may see pillar data intended for other threads or the pillar data seen by a thread might even change spuriously. There have been earlier attempts to fix this problem (#27937, #29397). These patches tried to fix the problem by storing the dictionary that keeps the relevant data in a thread-local variable and referencing this thread-local variable from the variables that are injected into the modules. These patches did not fix the problem completely because they only work when a module is loaded through a single loader instance only. When there is more than one loader, there is more than one thread-local variable and the variable injected into a module is changed to point to another thread-local variable when the module is loaded again. Thus, the problem resurfaced while working on #39670. This patch attempts to solve the problem from a slightly different angle, complementing the earlier patches: The value injected into the modules now is a proxy that internally uses a thread-local variable to decide to which object it points. This means that when loading a module again through a different loader (possibly passing different pillar data), the data is actually only changed in the thread in which the loader is used. Other threads are not affected by such a change. This means that it will work correctly in the current situation where loaders are possibly created by many different modules and these modules do not necessary know in which context they are executed. Thus it is much more flexible and reliable than the more explicit approach used by the two earlier patches. ### What issues does this PR fix or reference? This PR fixes problems that surfaced when developing the parallel runners feature (#39670), but is also related to problems reported earlier (#23373). The problems described in #29028 might also be related, though this needs further confirmation. ### Previous Behavior Changes to pillar data in one thread might have influenced pillar data in a different thread. Whether or when this problem actually appeared was unpredictable (due to the nature of a race condition). ### New Behavior Changes to pillar data in one thread will never affect the pillar data in a different thread. ### Tests written? No ### Regression Potential The change to the loader code itself is rather small, but it affects a central component. So if there is a problem, the impact might affect nearly all components. For this reason I dubmit this PR for the develop branch, even though it addresses a bug that is actually also present in older releases. Having said this, I believe that these changes should not cause any problems because to single-threaded processes, everything behaves as before, and for multi-threaded processes, the behavior is now more predictable.

Fix a bug where states.salt.runner() would always report success, even if the runner that was called raises an exception. ### How to reproduce the issue Create a simple test runner (`/srv/salt/_runner/testrunner.py`): ```python def test(): rasie Exception('This is an exception') ``` Now create a state that calls the runner (`/srv/salt/teststate.sls`): ```salt testrunner.test: salt.runner ``` Now execute the state with `salt-run state.orch teststate` ### Old behavior The orchestrator will report 1 successful state and 0 failures and display the error message as the changes of the ""successful"" state. (It will also report, that the changes are invalid, because the error message is not a dictionary, but it will show it nethertheless.) ### New behavior The state will now be marked as failed and the error message will be displayed as the comment if an exception is thrown from the runner. (Exceptions are already caught and the fail saved in `_low()` in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/client/mixins.py but the value is currently ignored by salt.states.salt.runner()) ### Backporting issues This fix can't be backported directly, as information about successful execution is only passed to the function since carbon, because `low()` in salt.client.mixins (e.g. https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/2015.8/salt/client/mixins.py) only returns `data['return']` before carbon. Since carbon `data` is returned completely and `data['success']` can be checked to determine if any exceptions where raised by the runner. (see https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/carbon/salt/client/mixins.py) To backport an argument like `full_return` with default value `False` could be added to the functions salt.runner.cmd() and salt.client.mixins.low() (like there is now since carbon), which can then be set to `True` when calling the first function in salt.modules.saltutil.runner() and the function then returns the complete `data` dictionary. ### Functions called when calling salt.states.salt.runner() - states.salt.runner() = states.saltmod.runner() - runner() in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/states/saltmod.py calls `saltutil.runner` - runner() in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/saltutil.py calls `salt.runner.RunnerClient.cmd()` - cmd() in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/runner.py calls `super().cmd()` (inherited from `mixins.SyncClientMixins`) - cmd() in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/client/mixins.py calls `self.low()` Before carbon: - low() executes the runner and returns only `data['result']` (=the return value of the runner). `data['success']` is set but never used Since carbon: - low() calls _low() which returns `data` completely if the parameter `full_return` is `True` (Which is the case if the runner is called with `states.salt.runner()`, see `runner()` in https://github.com/saltstack/salt/blob/develop/salt/modules/saltutil.py: it calls/returns `rclient.cmd()` with `full_return=True`) ### What issues does this PR fix or reference?

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,30062,develop::develop,0,merged,Release Notes::ZZZBugfix - [Done] back-ported::,"PR for #29601 that adds a new master configuration option of pillar_merge_lists: bool (default True) to readd backwards compatible of merging lists, while still maintaining the option to overwrite them. The modification of these default values concerns me a little bit because I'm worried that it might regress other functions that use this one. Is this necessary? ::Could you explain why these tests are removed? I'd definitely like to keep them around if possible. ::Commit 4af5b5c initially added the merge_lists=bool argument which caused the regression noted in #29601. This simply would set it back to True, as if it wasn't present to begin with and instead adds a new master_config opt of pillar_merge_lists (default True). In this way, it fixes the initially regression while still allowing someone to opt to not merge the lists by setting pillar_merge_lists: False in /etc/salt/master ::They were dropped because there'd be no pillar_source_merging_strategy of recurse_list as it would no longer be necessary. ::I agree with @cachedout's comment. ::@s0undt3ch Given that commit 4af5b5c33f8b082797eb5827f59c4681ff9fba03 added this option and set the default of merge_lists=False, a non-existent option until that commit, setting it to True by default would in essence, revert things back to the original functionality where lists were merged unless otherwise so chosen via a new configuration option of pillar_merge_lists in the master config.  Leaving this at False is much more likely to cause regressions imo, than leaving only some changes set back to True or in other words, the behavior prior to commit 4af5b5c33f8b082797eb5827f59c4681ff9fba03. Sorry if my comment is a bit confusing. ::Nope, that clarified it for me and the reasoning is good. Thanks! ::the default is `False`, isn't it? ::`merge_lists=True` doesn't seem to be tested here at all, or did I missed something out? ::Correct. @seanjnkns would you consider opening a quick PR to fix that mistake in the docs? 2015.8 would be a good target, since this was backported to 2015.8. ::@basepi, I did PRs 30602 and 30609 this morning to address this which has already been merged. ::Perfect, thank you! ::",41353b7ab3c1877f1b8802ed0c4efa317215a02e::f6a7aec3105a2a690bc26778a1dc52b50c4d9486::0ffea31666c0db895a2f56c66421f448ab71474c::1d7ee7bed25783af0eda07f77f061083bff9b31d::fb6e895bf024a19b07fc7840644f4ce55cadee1c::8fc656b6f2f55d207ea10fe686b05cea801fd497::

The pre-flight checks try to change to $HOME, this can fail for multiple reasons. One such case is that /root is a protected dir under SELinux which the master should not have access to. The daemon should instead change to the root dir which is the only dir that is always guaranteed to be there. The limited testing I have managed to do shows that windows accepts the '/' path too just fine so the os-specific case is not required either.

https://api.github.com/repos/saltstack/salt,25519,backport_vmware::2015.5,0,merged,RIoT::Salt-Cloud::,"Fixes #25511 @nmadhok - There were several deprecation paths added to salt-cloud in 2015.8, as noted in #25511 and also discovered in #23574. The problem is that this particular deprecation path cannot exist at the same time as supporting taking a development-version driver and placing it in a pre-2015.8.0 Salt installation. After discussing this with @techhat, we decided to backport your driver to 2015.5 (which will be available in 2015.5.4) and strip out any deprecation-related code. I did that in this PR. If people want to use the vmware driver on a pre-2015.8.0 installation, they'll need to grab the driver from 2015.5. @nmadhok - please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Fix configures tornado.netutil.ExecutorResolver for using as default DNS Resolver. But it is useful only when you provide own 'executor=' param to constructor. TCP Client creates resolver without additional params so ExecutorResolver uses dummy_executor (DummyExecutor) (see http://tornado.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_modules/tornado/concurrent.html) that simply calls function in synchronous blocking mode. It means that your Salt application still hangs in DNS resolving call and will be unresponsive to all events until resolving is finished.
