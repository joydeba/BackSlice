If a customer has an existing session (from 2.3.5-p2 or prior), and tries to access checkout with their existing session data, checkout will fail to load because the check to see if `captchaData[formId]` exists is not a valid function call. `_.isEmpty()` only returns a boolean value, so it cannot be enumerated like an array. Array access syntax has been moved in to the check, rather than outside it. <!--- Thank you for contributing to Magento. To help us process this pull request we recommend that you add the following information: - Summary of the pull request, - Issue(s) related to the changes made, - Manual testing scenarios Fields marked with (*) are required. Please don't remove the template. --> <!--- Please provide a general summary of the Pull Request in the Title above --> ### Description (*) This change allows a `_.isEmpty()` check in the `defaultCaptcha.js` file to complete successfully, resolving issues with the checkout failing to load or infinitely loading after upgrading. ### Related Pull Requests N/A ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) N/A - no reported issue for this yet? ### Manual testing scenarios (*) 1. Create an instance prior to 2.3.6 (eg: 2.3.5-p2) 2. Load the /checkout route in a valid way (eg: add to basket, create an account, click ""go to checkout"") 3. Observe the `captcha` key of the `mage-cache-storage` local storage key. There should **not** be an entry for `payment_processing_request` 4. Upgrade to 2.3.6 or another version that **does** include the fix introduced via [MC-36200](https://github.com/magento/magento2/commit/d31085aea48f151e0359ccc3c72d3585da3e96a1) 5. Load the `/checkout` route with the same session as before 6. Observe an infinite load on the checkout page and errors in the console along the lines of: ``` defaultCaptcha.js:60 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'timestamp' of undefined at UiClass.checkCustomerData (defaultCaptcha.js:60) at UiClass.<anonymous> (defaultCaptcha.js:43) at Function.each (jquery.js:382) at UiClass.initialize (defaultCaptcha.js:38) at UiClass.initialize (wrapper.js:109) at UiClass._super (wrapper.js:106) at UiClass.initialize (loginCaptcha.js:21) at UiClass.initialize (wrapper.js:109) at new UiClass (class.js:49) at Object.initComponent (layout.js:137) ``` 7. Apply patch 8. Attempt to load `/checkout` again 9. Observe checkout loads as expected ### Questions or comments I'm not sure if an issue is needed for this PR, but happy to make one if one is needed. This will also need to be backported to 2.3.6. ### Contribution checklist (*) - [ ] Pull request has a meaningful description of its purpose - [ ] All commits are accompanied by meaningful commit messages - [ ] All new or changed code is covered with unit/integration tests (if applicable) - [ ] All automated tests passed successfully (all builds are green) ### Resolved issues: 1.

If this option is not present then the product page will just render the product image, and nothing else as the getGalleryOptions() call will just return null. This is not a problem in vanilla Magento, as the argument is present in the layout file, however third party module providers, or anyone instantiating an instance of the ""\Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\View\Gallery"" class, or inheriting from it now needs to inject this argument for the template to render correctly. This has broken backwards compatability with old third party modules code, who now need to update to inject this argument. This PR introduces code into the phtml template, that detects if the option is not injected, and falls back to hard coded ""\Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\View\GalleryOptions"" class. ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) 1. magento/magento2#23432: When viewing product only the image shows ### Manual testing scenarios (*) 1. Remove argument ""gallery_options"" from ""catalog_product_view.xml"" in Magento_Catalog module. 2. Clear cache 3. View product page (product that has an image) 4. Ensure product page renders correctly. ### Questions or comments See notes and discussion in Original PR where it is being discussed whether to implement this series of PR's or not.

Theme inheritance does not work as expected with [translation dictionaries][1].  The child theme does not use any translations defined in it's parent theme's `en_US.csv` translation dictionary. ### Fixed Issues 1. magento/magento2#17833: Child theme does not inherit translations from parent theme ### Preconditions I'm working on a Magento ver 2.2.5 installation with two websites & two corresponding theme's.  Each with their own [translation dictionary][1], and one theme inheriting from the other. ### Manual testing scenarios 1. Set up a magento instance with two websites and with two theme's, one inheriting from luma and the other inheriting from the other theme you created.  See theme structure below. 2. Add a the translation string `""Create New Customer Account"",""Create New Account""` to the parent theme's `en_US.csv` translation dictionary. 3. Go to the _/customer/account/create/_ URL for the website with the child theme applied. **Expected result** The page title should be _Create New Account_ **Actual result** The page title is still _Create New Customer Account_ - If go to the _/customer/account/create/_ URL for the website with the parent theme applied, the page title should is _Create New Account_.  So the child theme is not picking up translations from the parent theme. - If you add the translation string `""Create New Customer Account"",""Create New Account""` to the Child theme's `en_US.csv` translation dictionary you can see the translation string applied corectly on the website with the child theme applied. Is this a bug with Magento or am I doing something wrong? Is the [translation dictionary][1] documentation incorrect and this is actually the correct behaviour? ### Contribution checklist - [ ] Pull request has a meaningful description of its purpose - [ ] All commits are accompanied by meaningful commit messages - [ ] All new or changed code is covered with unit/integration tests (if applicable) - [ ] All automated tests passed successfully (all builds on Travis CI are green) Hi @vpodorozh, please use `DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR` instead of `'/'`. ::Hi @vpodorozh, since Magento 2.2 supports PHP 7.0 you can't use nullable return types as this is a feature of PHP 7.1 and higher.

It doesn't guarantees that the duplicated product actually is saved at the second or third trial and so on. It means, that having any piece of code, that causes getting any of catched exceptions breaks your website. It could be not the Magento module, but having such loop makes an opportunity of having infinite loop and broken production, because someone didn't write the module in the right way.::I agree with @oleksii-lisovyi here, this do while loop can cause [major problems](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9466), this should be solved in a better way then doing a potential infinite loop. Finding a unique url key should not be done by trying to save a product over and over again, this should be done separately somehow.::@oleksii-lisovyi @hostep > } catch (\Magento\Framework\Exception\AlreadyExistsException $e) { > } catch (\Magento\UrlRewrite\Model\Exception\UrlAlreadyExistsException $e) { Such exceptions are specific enough, if some third-party code throws them permanently - it really needs to be fixed. The problem mentioned is solved in 2.3 and loop is still there: https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/50592b4fb359b1daba9de7b554c9c8afa1d8d160/app/code/Magento/Catalog/Model/Product/Copier.php#L92 > Finding a unique url key should not be done by trying to save a product over and over again, this should be done separately somehow. Please tell more about this ""somehow"". Main purpose of this code is to avoid race condition (when some URL Key we would use was added by somebody else). Otherwise we would just try the next free URL Key and it would work. And again, 2.2 should not live on its own, any backportable fix from 2.3 must be backported.::> Main purpose of this code is to avoid race condition Aha, I wasn't aware of the purpose of this code, but this makes sense indeed! Some inline comments might prove useful here. > Please tell more about this ""somehow"" If it's to avoid a race condition, then this will be pretty hard to do indeed. Can't we just show an error when a duplicate url key was detected and tell to user to retry or something like that?::@hostep why? This code simply works in 2.3 and I see no issue in it for 2.2::Because a save method can trigger things you don't want to trigger more than once. In the case of https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9466, calling save more than once copies the image files on the filesystem associated with the product more than once, even though by duplicating a product, you expect the image files to only be copied a single time. Just some wild idea: can we not first add a completely random unique bunch of characters (a hash if you will) as a url key to the duplicated product, then save the product, and then generate a more sensible url key using that do while loop and only save that on the product so only a single attribute gets changed?::@hostep if things are added more than once when calling `save`, they are not implemented well.::",a5e6d355e69164a5d69d918165902916e775b9bc::

This is an issue we've been having on a Magento 2.1 shop for almost 2 years now and this backport finally fixes it. This only happens when you have a database mysql replication setup in a master-master setup and you have the mysql variable `binlog_format` set to `ROW`. We had this problem using Percona versions 5.6.32 & 5.7.16, but probably every Mysql version is affected. So the actual issue: we have a whole lot of products and categories, we sort the products in the categories with the position field. But when reindexing the `catalog_category_product` indexer, we noticed that the resulting positions of products in a category in the table `catalog_category_product_index` ended up being incorrect and completely out of whack. Eventually we found out this was caused by the mysql setting `binlog_format` which was set to `ROW`, which is the recommended and default setting. We then switched this to `MIXED` which solved the problem. But since a few months, we've been running into a lot of DEADLOCKS which seem to happen out of the blue, and according to our hosting partner, it was caused by the `MIXED` setting. And they advised us to switch back to `ROW`. But then we had to first figure out a solution for the incorrect product positions in categories, and then we suddenly found the [MAGETWO-60258](https://github.com/magento/magento2/search?q=MAGETWO-60258&type=Commits) commits in the github history of Magento 2.2 which had an exact description of our problem. So we've patched that solution in our 2.1 shop and switched back to `ROW` and now the problem is gone. This has been running for a week now and the initial problem is fixed by this. Hence the backport, to help people who also run into this same problem with Magento 2.1. Also: if this PR isn't allowed for some reason, I hope the description in here helps people find a solution if they run into this same problem, because this was really hard to find for us. #### Further remarks I've changed the version of this migration from 2.1.4 to 2.1.4.1, since [2.1.4](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.1.14/app/code/Magento/Catalog/etc/module.xml#L9) is already used in Magento 2.1, and the same migration in Magento 2.2 is using version [2.1.5](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.2.5/app/code/Magento/Catalog/Setup/UpgradeSchema.php#L71) for this migration. I'm not sure if there is some kind of policy for using a specific version numbering schema when backporting database migrations, so feel free to tell me if this isn't correct. Since this drops and recreates a temporary table it shouldn't cause problems when going from Magento 2.1 to 2.2 later on. It will just do the exact same action again. Then just informational, the mysql table `catalog_category_product_index_tmp` format will change from: ```sql CREATE TABLE `catalog_category_product_index_tmp` ( `category_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Category ID', `product_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Product ID', `position` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Position', `is_parent` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Is Parent', `store_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Store ID', `visibility` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'Visibility', KEY `CAT_CTGR_PRD_IDX_TMP_PRD_ID_CTGR_ID_STORE_ID` (`product_id`,`category_id`,`store_id`) ) ENGINE=MEMORY DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT='Catalog Category Product Indexer Temp Table'; ``` to: ```sql CREATE TABLE `catalog_category_product_index_tmp` ( `category_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Category ID', `product_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Product ID', `position` int(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Position', `is_parent` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Is Parent', `store_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT 'Store ID', `visibility` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL COMMENT 'Visibility', PRIMARY KEY (`category_id`,`product_id`,`store_id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT='Catalog Category Product Indexer temporary table'; ``` ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) None that I could find ### Manual testing scenarios 1. Magento 2.1.12 2. Mysql master-master replication setup with `binlog_format` set to `ROW` 3. Have a category with a whole lot of products where each has a different position inside the category 4. Reindex the `catalog_category_product` indexer 5. Notice that the product positions in the `catalog_category_product_index` don't follow the positions set in the backend of Magento and thus also the sort order of products on the frontend becomes incorrect. ### Contribution checklist - [ ] Pull request has a meaningful description of its purpose - [ ] All commits are accompanied by meaningful commit messages - [ ] All new or changed code is covered with unit/integration tests (if applicable) - [ ] All automated tests passed successfully (all builds on Travis CI are green)",a7f9b096830f6fa94419a800509b12d0ba056cef::

This PR was triggered by some discussions over here: https://github.com/davidalger/capistrano-magento2/issues/102 When you read the Magento [documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/performance-best-practices/deployment-flow.html) around performance best practices for deploying to a production environment, you'll see something like this: > Run the following command to preprocess and compile DI: > `bin/magento setup:di:compile` > After compilation completes, we recommend running the following command: > `composer dump-autoload -o` > This command allows Composer to rebuild the mapping to project files so that they load faster. Since the docs mention you should dump the autoloader after certain php classes got autogenerated, you would assume that the autoloader classmap file (`vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php`) should have a mapping of those generated classes. But that isn't the case right now. This PR fixes this. This should - in theory - increase the autoloading performance ever so slightly on production environments, since the autoloader wouldn't have to go searching for files on the filesystem but would already find them in the classmap and wouldn't have to perform `file_exists` calls for those generated classes. Watch out: 1) I haven't tested this out on a real project yet. This was only done after some debugging and tinkering and reading the `vendor/composer/ClassLoader.php` file and some research on the world wide web. 2) I'm not exactly sure if this should go into the `""psr-4""`or the `""psr-0""` or the `""classmap""` section of the `""autoload""` section in the `composer.json` file. It was already suggested to put it in the `classmap` section over here: https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/9102 but I'm not sure after reading the [composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload)? It seems to work in all 3 sections while testing, but I've decided to put it in the already being used `""psr-0""` section for now. 3) If this gets approved, this change will also have to go into the meta package `magento/project-community-edition` of which the sources I can't seem to find on github (unless the `composer.json` file which comes with it is somehow build using the `composer.json` file of this project?) 4) If this gets approved, it wouldn't be a bad idea to put this in the release notes of whatever version this gets released in, since the `composer.json` file of already existing projects doesn't get updated automatically after upgrading to a newer version of Magento. 5) If this gets backported all the way down to Magento 2.1, the path should become `var/generation/` ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) None that I could find ### Manual testing scenarios 1.

Added to page html (https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.2-develop/app/code/Magento/Theme/view/frontend/templates/js/polyfill.phtml) 2. As part of jquery.storageapi library  - https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.2-develop/lib/web/jquery/jquery.storageapi.min.js These implementation are fully different. 1st one works good, but 2nd one adds strange behavior - adds separate cookie with `ls_` prefix in name for each item that should be stored in localstorage and `ss_<some_id>_` for session storage. As result - when customer goes through website - it will add new and new cookies (because of this strange `ss_<some_id>_` prefix). For some reasons sometimes, probably because of race conditions, we're having 2nd implementation used instead of 1st one. This PR moving 1st implementation into head section (before requirejs), so it will be loaded first for sure.

https://api.github.com/repos/magento/magento2,16999,2.3-develop-PR-port-16435::2.3-develop,0,closed,duplicate::,"### Original Pull Request https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/16435 … the autoloader on a production environment the autoloader will find more classes in its classmap. This should result in fewer file_exists calls and might increase the performance a tiny bit. As @orlangur requested, this is a backport of #15438 for Magento 2.2 ### Description Hi! This PR was triggered by some discussions over here: https://github.com/davidalger/capistrano-magento2/issues/102 When you read the Magento [documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/performance-best-practices/deployment-flow.html) around performance best practices for deploying to a production environment, you'll see something like this: > Run the following command to preprocess and compile DI: > `bin/magento setup:di:compile` > After compilation completes, we recommend running the following command: > `composer dump-autoload -o` > This command allows Composer to rebuild the mapping to project files so that they load faster. Since the docs mention you should dump the autoloader after certain php classes got autogenerated, you would assume that the autoloader classmap file (`vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php`) should have a mapping of those generated classes. But that isn't the case right now. This PR fixes this. This should - in theory - increase the autoloading performance ever so slightly on production environments, since the autoloader wouldn't have to go searching for files on the filesystem but would already find them in the classmap and wouldn't have to perform `file_exists` calls for those generated classes. Watch out: 1) I haven't tested this out on a real project yet. This was only done after some debugging and tinkering and reading the `vendor/composer/ClassLoader.php` file and some research on the world wide web. 2) I'm not exactly sure if this should go into the `""psr-4""`or the `""psr-0""` or the `""classmap""` section of the `""autoload""` section in the `composer.json` file. It was already suggested to put it in the `classmap` section over here: https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/9102 but I'm not sure after reading the [composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#autoload)? It seems to work in all 3 sections while testing, but I've decided to put it in the already being used `""psr-0""` section for now. 3) If this gets approved, this change will also have to go into the meta package `magento/project-community-edition` of which the sources I can't seem to find on github (unless the `composer.json` file which comes with it is somehow build using the `composer.json` file of this project?) 4) If this gets approved, it wouldn't be a bad idea to put this in the release notes of whatever version this gets released in, since the `composer.json` file of already existing projects doesn't get updated automatically after upgrading to a newer version of Magento. 5) If this gets backported all the way down to Magento 2.1, the path should become `var/generation/` ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) None that I could find ### Manual testing scenarios 1.

I've noticed that the range of deleted order items processed by the mentioned method was too wide because it's supposed to delete only virtual and bundle items with products not shipped separately. The previous condition checked wether the product was virtual or had a parentId and not separately shipped, but this check deleted also simple products related to configurables introducing an issue with shipments for configurable products. My proposed change would check if the product is virtual or bundle (not shipped seperately) to delete from processed items. This issue doesn't have any consequence in 2.2 and 2.3 because the method `getAllItems()` of entity shipment is never used inside the core modules; but it will affect the MSI classes related to the `SourceDeductionProcessor` where this method is used to cycle the shipment items.

I think that it should instead use the storeId set on the actual collection. <!--- Provide a general summary of the Pull Request in the Title above --> ### Description Now joinUrlRewrite uses directly the storeManager, but if a store is set directly on the collection, it should use the store set, and not the default passed by the store manager. The method getStoreId(), if not set, already goes on fallback to the store manager and get the default, so it should be safe to directly use getStoreId(). ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) <!--- Provide a list of fixed issues in the format magento/magento2#<issue_number>, if relevant  --> 1. magento/magento2#13704: Category\Collection::joinUrlRewrite should use the store set on the collection ### Manual testing scenarios I already provided an automated unit test.

https://api.github.com/repos/magento/magento2,13687,proposition-to-change-minify-exclude-configurations::2.3-develop,0,merged,Progress: accept::Release Line: 2.3::,"### Description This is a first proposition at changing how the configuration value `minify_exclude` can be used. I have the feeling Magento's purpose of this configuration value was to be able to be used in multiple modules. But currently this is not possible, since it is a simple value in the xml config. Which means that when multiple modules define this configuration, the value of the last module in the sequence wil be used. I think Magento's purpose was to make this configuration mergeable, which it currently isn't. Concrete example, module A defines: ``` <config> <default> <dev> <js> <minify_exclude> /regex1/ </minify_exclude> </js> <css> <minify_exclude> /regex1/ </minify_exclude> </css> </dev> </default> </config> ``` and module B defines: ``` <config> <default> <dev> <js> <minify_exclude> /regex2/ </minify_exclude> </js> <css> <minify_exclude> /regex2/ </minify_exclude> </css> </dev> </default> </config> ``` Then the result of this should be that these values get merged, but now they are overwritten by one of the two modules and only `/regex1/` or `/regex2/` is used depending on which module is loaded as last. In practice, I've encountered modules which add a single line to this configuration, which then removes the default `/tiny_mce/` regex which in turn causes the wysiwyg fields in the backend to no longer work. This happens because the values of xml nodes are overwritten and not merged when identical nodes are encountered. The proposition here, is to add a bit more structure to the xml, and to define a node per value, where each node name should be unique as to allow them to be merged. The current solution to this problem which is circulating is a workaround and not very ""user friendly"" for developers to implement: https://magento.stackexchange.com/a/198480/2911 Some other remarks: - I created this PR against the `2.3-develop` branch as this introduces a backwards incompatible change and this PR should *not* be backported to an older version of Magento. - Is it somehow possible that these configuration values are stored in the database? If yes: then we should add an upgrade script as well, to change those database values to the new format. - If this gets accepted, this should be clearly noted in the release notes, so that developers are aware of this change - I'm pretty sure some tests will fail, and I'll do my best to fix them, but some help might be needed, and maybe some extra tests should be added to verify that the merging of this configuration actually works I'm open to remarks or other ideas to improve this! :) ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) 1. https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/11577: TinyMCE (WYSIWYG) doesn't work in admin when JS minify is enabled ### 3rd party modules which run against this problem: - https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-magento2/pull/213 - https://github.com/magespecialist/m2-MSP_ReCaptcha/issues/21 - https://github.com/Magenerds/PageDesigner/issues/17 - ... ### Contribution checklist - [x] Pull request has a meaningful description of its purpose - [x] All commits are accompanied by meaningful commit messages - [ ] All new or changed code is covered with unit/integration tests (if applicable) - [ ] All automated tests passed successfully (all builds on Travis CI are green) getValue returns string. Why don't you exploding this string like it was in original implementation? Looks like it's an error.::Hi @alexeya-ven `getValue` doesn't always return a string, the return value is being defined as [`mixed`](https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/231709b/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/App/Config/ScopeConfigInterface.php#L27) In this case it returns an array instead of a string, because an extra level of nodes was added in the xml tree. So it's no longer a long string which could consist of multiple lines. But zero, one or multiple xml nodes instead. By then using `array_values`, I'm getting the contents of those xml nodes which gives us an array of strings again, like the initial implementation did (which used `explode`). The idea was to make this configuration mergeable so you can add multiple exclusions from different modules, which wasn't possible before, one module overwrote the configuration of another module. I hope this makes it a bit more clear?::",d1f1252ccbb8d1dc132e9596f30a2acb8994d35f::

The Apache documentation for the Options Directive mentions the following: _**Warning** Mixing Options with a + or - with those without is not valid syntax and is likely to cause unexpected results._ http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options So occording to the documentation ""Options All -Indexes"" is not valid syntax. Removed the option ""All"" from the .htaccess file. This is the default option. We only want to make sure that the Indexes option is not present, so that Apache will not return a list of files in the directory. The ExecCGI option will be disabled by the .htaccess as well. The FollowSymLinks option will be set automatically when the mod_rewrite module is found. As far is I can see there is no need to set or unset the other options in the Options Directive, so it's safe to remove the option All from the .htaccess files. ### Backport This PR is a backport of: magento/magento2#11327",704960a6a1af41c95e9e1c90b11016426ab5d5b5::

And this is dangerous to substitute empty value with ""No"" as empty value may appear for different reasons (e.g. empty text field, dropdown without selected item, etc.). Magento should rid of such code, decrease coupling between different classes and do not base implementation on current execution flow but build reusable components with high cohesion so changes in one system part will not cause bugs in another.::Actually, behavior was changed when `instanceof Phrase` was added to `if` below. I can see that `__('N/A')` code was dead for a long time (including M1) so expectations in most Magento versions not used attributes are not displayed on a storefornt product page. Support also has multiple tickets to return previous behavior (not show N/A) back. ::Thanks, I wan't aware about M1, and yes, such useful behavior was introduced accidentally in scope of another bugfix.::This `if` formatting looks pretty strange, should it be on next line or `elseif`?

I didn't notice that this was a backport, so that's on me! As for strict comparison, it really is a standard practice in all cases. Linters in standard configuration will complain.

In the TinyMCE editor, we can no longer select images (or widgets, which are represented by an image), so we can no longer edit images (or widgets) using the TinyMCE editor. See https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9518 for more detailed info with links to a bunch of external sources. ### Fixed Issues (if relevant) 1. https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/9518: Chrome version 58 causes problems with selections in the TinyMCE editor ### Manual testing scenarios 1. Start editing a CMS page in the backend of Magento using Google Chrome version 58 2. Make sure you have a CMS page which contains an image and/or a widget 3. Try to select the image or the widget, by clicking it 4. You won't succeed, because a JS error is being thrown: `Failed to execute 'setBaseAndExtent' on 'Selection': There is no child at offset 1.` ### Contribution checklist - [x] Pull request has a meaningful description of its purpose - [x] All commits are accompanied by meaningful commit messages - [ ] All new or changed code is covered with unit/integration tests (if applicable) - [x] All automated tests passed successfully (all builds on Travis CI are green) ### Discussion I only briefly tested these changes, only on Chrome 58 and Safari 10.1, so it would be highly appreciated if someone else can test all browsers which Magento supports and see if this doesn't break any other browser. I applied the changes to all tiny_mce scripts I could find, although I think only the `tiny_mce_src.js` one is used in the backend of Magento. But since you bundle all the other scripts in Magento, It could be possible that someone is using another script, so I assumed this should be fixed in all the tiny_mce scripts. Also: the minified tiny_mce scripts were manually edited, I don't know the command which was being used to generate the minified scripts, so please double check that my manual edits are ok. Since this bug will probably popup with a lot of shopowners in the near future, this fix should get a bit of a higher priority and should also get backported to Magento versions 2.1 and 2.0 as soon as possible. If this PR is accepted, I can create a backport for version 2.1, but not sure how backporting to 2.0 is supposed to work?",4d10f05c4d015e59e6628bd58782a811b61b13a6::

When you create a sitemap and have the option checked to automatically add it to the robots.txt file, everything goes south. Because the assertWritable checks if the parent directory is writable which is totally not nescessary because the file is writable. Additionally there were some inconsistencies in the filesystem directory stuff. And as an extra there is an extra check to avoid concatinating the absolute basepath with a path that is already absolute. (this could for example cause basepath='/var/www/website', path='/var/www/website/robots.txt' if you pass in both to get the aboslute path the result would be '/var/www/website/var/www/website/robots.txt' which was not the goal, now it wil properly return '/var/www/website/robots.txt') It would be nice to have these fixes backported to 2.0 and 2.1 because we have this sort of issues in our production environments at the moment.",6cd28e8c05dbabe887a33b02bdfde710805d65e6::abbb03e84ad6f004a3a670b1f8208ba36084fb0d::
