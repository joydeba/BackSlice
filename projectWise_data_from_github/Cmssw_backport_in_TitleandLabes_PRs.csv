The additional removal of `SiPixelCPEGenericErrorParmRcd` from `112X_dataRun2_HLT_relval_v3` and `112X_dataRun2_HLT_relval_HI_v2` is a technical change only, removing an obsolete record.

Well, I couldn't find any and I don't think it's even possible because the HIPhotonIsolation is a custom class. Hence, we can't use the existing mechanisms for `int` and `float` ValueMaps.

Specifically, these were coming from the EcalIntegrityMemBlockSizeErrors collection and occurred for a number of events in runs 338624 and 338628. At least in run 338628, this was always occurring with the same unphysical coordinates: MemBlockSizeError: dccId: 24 towerId: 70 It turns out that towerIDs 69 and 70 correspond to the MEM boxes for most ECAL SMs. These MEM boxes also have a front-end (FE) status that was not being displayed, due to the code assuming these coordinates are unphysical. Integrity errors for towerID 69 had been masked before not knowing that these towerIDs do have a meaning: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/95eed04a96ac618a285c8388001c3542a3f0445f In this PR we now handle the two additional tower IDs and plots the FE status and integrity errors for these MEM boxes. The plots contain two bins for each SM corresponding to tower IDs 69 and 70, respectively. The plots are indexed by ECAL DCC ID, where each DCC ID corresponds to a SM. The mapping from DCC ID to SM name appears below. ``` 01:EE-07  19:EB-10  37:EB+10 02:EE-08  20:EB-11  38:EB+11 03:EE-09  21:EB-12  39:EB+12 04:EE-01  22:EB-13  40:EB+13 05:EE-02  23:EB-14  41:EB+14 06:EE-03  24:EB-15  42:EB+15 07:EE-04  25:EB-16  43:EB+16 08:EE-05  26:EB-17  44:EB+17 09:EE-06  27:EB-18  45:EB+18 10:EB-01  28:EB+01  46:EE+07 11:EB-02  29:EB+02  47:EE+08 12:EB-03  30:EB+03  48:EE+09 13:EB-04  31:EB+04  49:EE+01 14:EB-05  32:EB+05  50:EE+02 15:EB-06  33:EB+06  51:EE+03 16:EB-07  34:EB+07  52:EE+04 17:EB-08  35:EB+08  53:EE+05 18:EB-09  36:EB+09  54:EE+06 ``` #### PR validation: New plots successfully generated with online ECAL DQM workflow and uploaded to a private DQM GUI without any issues. #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: This is a backport of the original PR here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32443 This is done to ensure the changes are available in CMSSW_11_2_X, which would be used in the next MWGR in February 2021.::",aba3ed18d3342af5dfb8361c122cbe9557f6fe88::

Below, a copy of the description from the original PR: --- This PR implements a small, backward-compatible, update to the `PuppiProducer`. The Puppi algorithm uses the number of reconstructed primary vertices as a proxy for the amount of PU in the event; specifically, this is used in the threshold for the pT cut on neutral candidates. The PR just adds the functionality to select a different (generic) quantity as PU proxy, adding a switch (`usePUProxyValue`) and an `InputTag` to a `double` in the event. Some internal functions are renamed accordingly for clarity. This small update is currently used in Phase-2 HLT-TDR studies, and the intention is to backport it to `11_1_X`. Defaults are unchanged, so no changes are expected in the comparisons. FYI: @lathomas @kirschen @fwyzard @trtomei @pallabidas --- #### PR validation: Verified in HLT-TDR studies that the updated code behaves as expected. #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: #32341 Backport needed for Phase-2 HLT-TDR studies in `11_1_X`.::",e6b181ba4108de902f484566ca666088e439f7cb::

For the record, the crash only happens when running the NANO step alone, but is not visible when both NANO and DQM:@nanoAODDQM steps are run (hence why it wasn't spotted earlier). The fix consists to rearrange the order of some modules. In addition, it was noticed that some booleans were not properly set for MC when recreating the jet PUPPI collection. This is now corrected. Finally, the V15 PUPPI was in fact NOT enabled in the previous PR for reNANOAOD since only the run2_miniAOD_UL modifier was considered. This is also corrected.

The following changes are implemented: * Track to PV association is preformed in a similar way as for tracks contained in `packedPFCandidates` collection (packed PF particles); * Detailed track information is stored down to 0.5GeV instead of current 0.95GeV as done for packed PF particles (`packedPFCandidates`). Track covariance packing schemas are adapted from producer of the packed PF particle collection for more effective packing. Note: Code was formatted with `scam b code-format` for easier backport and better comparison with master. MiniAOD size changes were estimated with 1k of DY->LL evens with 2018 conditions and it is as follows: * size increase of `patPackedCandidates_lostTracks__PAT`: 23% * size increase of full miniAOD sample: 0.2% * 1/4 of the increase comes from updated PV association information, while remaining 3/4 from lowering threshold to store detailed track info.

Notable changes: - data / MC flag which is autodetected in case of data conversion into raw (FRD) format. For HLT it was requested to have this feature for MWGRs / Hilton tests - support reading TCDS record from a range of FED IDs. MiniDAQs is the primary target to benefit from it with 11_1_X (likely to stay with this release series longer than Central DAQ) and will allow their data to have proper event ID instead of current 24-bit one which wraps frequently. - additional modes used for the input source reading the new raw FRD format with file header. Allows format to be used with file locking (e.g. in Hilton if FRD rawa dat is produced as the new format). - bugfixes for some modes of input source reading (although not default in production system). #### PR validation: Tested in DAQ VM test cluster (applied to CMSSW_11_1_4) #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: Backport of 11_2_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30206 https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30457 (except DataFormats/TCDS changes) https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31543 ::,023de932c00f53901c9b17e04b6eabd15c89b032::0ab5804ea1aa04f413565658dea1c0bd7919f6c5::e8b27ee522dc13c4a0e780a79e042076b83f01ff::cad8419dffcac6157afbff4e67e726136a4fe5c3::cc1f76035162175b7a30050fe8793d8e529f0735::ddfa969805f1877cd239856d891feaa097dc6c2b::b936e55a76feec8d6af206fb1a40853abb8c09e0::b2fd20e63115b9a3fc96f40645d82bc1197eeca6::bf84e3e42530765962dc9c59353ce18ba08d508f::62f0a90abb0bf2164c2e360b36a986dc0d932ace::873f8fa9536b830bbdbba84d3d54d9fa58e48e5b::5a69c751790971b11c9191182adc0fad8c1dd588::45e0d7059faaae20ef95a5d7f2d9c37e42fa8c5d::b9df84349edb79719b9b7d00606088aa36f39a12::94830f7cc9c7bd0804da907e0d9f2b638de88f97::b61c5d9f69b3b9584831d8d467220f3c7ec32dab::820e07c8ac8fe6b7b3253c4244cee622ebd8eea5::58f5c76c9591b715d7acf2bf01673acc27120fa3::81c6a80837a9935976a5c66a1c5281d10b568584::91c71d70759869bc35620fa638dae06f0e73b8c7::7126a839915bb9cafa1031c7f71e2734f1d3a741::573101767652b86afa73135cf63ce08fc8550ca8::7aace4960b198829d3ddcd664adb60be2b1c3956::2d862bca7c7b3ded91969cd6752f948c7b5250e2::9449d989e39023e830a4ec46ad4f7bfc2b3997a5::

The default configuration is not touched here, but may only be changed after successful validation of PUPPI v15 for Phase-2. This introduces the option to use a new treatment of the track-vertex association for charged particles in PUPPI. The new version is called v15. The vertex association is adapted to deal with split vertices in high hadronic activity events (more on this here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/944339/contributions/3968152/attachments/2086414/3505127/splitverticesandhighptjets.pdf). Charged particles associated to one of the leading two pileup vertices by the vertex fit (fromPV=0), but found within dz<0.2 of the primary vertex are treated as coming from the primary vertex. This reduces MET tails due to particles that are wrongly associated to a PU vertex, when the PV is reconstructed as 2-3 split vertices. The overall impact on jet response, jet efficiency, fake rate, boosted object tagging is negligible. Thus JEC and SFs derived with PUPPI v14 are applicable to PUPPI v15. A summary of the studies is in: https://indico.cern.ch/event/942994/contributions/3978585/attachments/2088015/3508036/puppiv15summary-1.pdf An additional check on softdrop mass response for high pT AK8 jets can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/942994/#7-virtual-impact-of-puppi-tune #### PR validation: scram b run-tests runTheMatrix.py -l limited #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: Backport of #31174 and #31887::this part does not match the master version, where phase2 (either default or with this custom function) would give `NumOfPUVtxsForCharged = 0, EtaMinUseDeltaZ = -1.`. A consistent behavior should be provided (either the default master version for phase2 would need to change or this method be consistently updated. BTW, this `UpdatePuppiTuneV15` is itself pretty confusing because it still contains ""fake"" overrides to values which are already set to V14 values by calling `makePuppiesFromMiniAOD`, which loads the release default. Some cleanup would be useful so that only values that need changing are actually explicitly changed.::@ahinzmann please clarify on the status of following up on the code review for this PR. Thank you. ::The idea is to some Phase-2 plots with this recipe first, before actually changing the master.

My understanding is that it's better to update this in separate PR (both for 106X and master). I'm guessing that the update was made in a wrong place. - my comment was about the `metFilters = cms.Sequence(`, which defines results of a path `Flag_METFilters = cms.Path(metFilters)`. This part still needs an update to be protected with `run2_miniAOD_UL`. If the combined Flag_METFilters is outdated, it's fine to remove `hfNoisyHitsFilter` here for good, but then it better be also removed in the master as well. - your update was in `metFilterPathsTask`, which is used in `slimmingTask` in case someone is to consume the bool tags produced by one of the modules. At this point (nothing is consuming this bool, AFAIK) it's a mostly technical update, but it would still need a match in the master first before this 106X can proceed. ::@lathomas do I understand correctly that the combined `Flag_METFilters` is not supported/recommended anymore?

This backport follows in large part the original PR, but it is not entirely trivial; this is due to the significant differences in the `PuppiProducer`'s implementation in `10_6_X` (wrt later releases), and the need to not introduce any numerical changes in the outputs (no-change policy). These requirements led to adding more members to the `PuppiCandidate` struct (compared to the original PR): * an `int` named `puppi_register`, due to the fact that in this release a given Puppi candidate has two IDs associated to it (named puppi ""register"" and puppi ""id"" in the source code), while in `11_X` only one is used (currently called `id`); * four floats (`px`, `py`, `pz`, `e`) for the candidate's p4; this is used in the `PuppiProducer` when storing the candidates kinematics (see `puppiP4s` in the `PuppiProducer`; in `11_X`, things are done differently and this change was not needed); recomputing `(px,py,pz,e)` on-the-fly based on `(pt,eta,phi,m)` would introduce small numerical changes in the outputs, and the only way I found to avoid this was to add more members to the `PuppiCandidate` struct. The improvement in computational performance is approx. 45% (from ~27ms to ~15ms for one instance of the `PuppiProducer` in the `PAT` step of a 2017 MC workflow); this is slighly less than the speedup in the original PR (which was closer to 60%), maybe partly due to the fact that the `PuppiCandidate` struct here includes more data members. A couple of minor changes from #31164 in `PuppiContainer.h` (renaming of a data member, and removal of an unused getter) are avoided here for simplicity. No changes in the outputs are expected. FYI: @ahinzmann @lathomas @kirschen #### PR validation: Checked that the PUPPI weights of all PF candidates are unchanged for 500 events of a 2017 MC workflow (`PAT` step), for both `puppi` (used for jets) and `puppiNoLep` (used for MET). Standard workflows, i.e. `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`, ran successfully. #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: #31164 (with limited modifications needed to enforce the no-change policy) This speeedup could be useful for UL re-miniAOD and analysis.::The master version uses `and getsDefaultWgtIfApplyCHS` in the second conditional instead of `and iConstits[i0].puppi_register != 0`. Are these equivalent? If yes, a redefinition of `getsDefaultWgtIfApplyCHS` may be in order. If no, please elaborate (in this case, the separate definition of `getsDefaultWgtIfApplyCHS` seems unnecessary because it is not reused anywhere else). also a linebreak at/after `or` would be nice::In practice, I think the condition `id == 1 or id == 2` corresponds to `register != 0` (looking at how `puppi_register` is filled [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31290/files#diff-920ad87cd21790b241508fda9a732044L56)), but in principle the two things can differ (or at least, I wanted to make no assumptions). The logic behind how these changes are implemented is the following: `goodVar` needs to be calculated when the final weight of the candidate is non-trivial (this is the first condition, which corresponds to the logical NOT of [these two cases](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/a27570aa535de693b718c4abd25258f6dfb694fc/CommonTools/PileupAlgos/src/PuppiContainer.cc#L275-L276)), or when the `goodVar` of a given candidate is needed internally by [`PuppiAlgo::add`, here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/a27570aa535de693b718c4abd25258f6dfb694fc/CommonTools/PileupAlgos/src/PuppiAlgo.cc#L110-L116); in `10_6_X`, the latter condition translates to `(.. < etaMaxExtrap) and puppi_register != 0`, while in `11_X_Y` the criterion is `(.. < etaMaxExtrap) and (id == 1 or id == 2)` (see [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/af81ead1e2eecda9b39833574cd462337628d084/CommonTools/PileupAlgos/src/PuppiAlgo.cc#L100-L106)). So, the logic is the same here and in the original PR; the end result looks different just as a consequence of the fact that the `Puppi{Container,Algo}` implementation is different in the two releases. I added a commit to remove the temporary variable `getsDefaultWgtIfApplyCHS`, which was indeed only used once, and took the opportunity to add the linebreak.::",a27570aa535de693b718c4abd25258f6dfb694fc::9ed0cf651803b39a65ad1a358d680f10cb1322f5::

The new version is called v15. The vertex association is adapted to deal with split vertices in high hadronic activity events (more on this here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/944339/contributions/3968152/attachments/2086414/3505127/splitverticesandhighptjets.pdf). Charged particles associated to one of the leading two pileup vertices by the vertex fit (fromPV=0), but found within dz<0.2 of the primary vertex are treated as coming from the primary vertex. This reduces MET tails due to particles that are wrongly associated to a PU vertex, when the PV is reconstructed as 2-3 split vertices. The overall impact on jet response, jet efficiency, fake rate, boosted object tagging is negligible. Thus JEC and SFs derived with PUPPI v14 are applicable to PUPPI v15.

The major changes are: 1. AK4 CHS jets, AK4 Puppi jets and AK4 Gen jets are reclustered from MiniAODs and are used to replace slimmedJets, slimmedJetsPuppi and slimmedGenJets. The rationale behind this is to store very low pt jets (as low as 2 GeV) needed for jet energy scale and resolution studies by JERC group. 2. AK4 Puppi jets have almost the same set of variables stored as AK4 CHS jets. To be used for performance comparison studies between AK4 CHS jets and AK4 Puppi jets. 3. Add PF jet multiplicity variables for different PF candidate types. **if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:** Original PR is #30674 **NOTE**: Requires NanoAODv7 to be backported (#31063) and then an earlier backport (#29290) to be merged first before this PR can be merged.::",716592b7a242be68c670c0c164ff76f65e73800b::

Investigation showed only ME1/2 LCTs (oddly enough) with invalid pattern numbers. This was fixed with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/9354dff643d672ed1d864559d757a53082355968. Further investigation revealed that the CLCT processor readout function was not checking if CLCTs were valid, and that GEM-CSC motherboards do not check if incoming pads are valid. The code was also missing quality control. I added a number of `checkValid` functions that check the properties for ALCT/CLCT/LCT at various stages of the algorithm. LogErrors are printed in case values go out of bounds. #### PR validation: Tested on 10k events of - `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-PU25ns_110X_mcRun4_realistic_v3_2026D49PU200-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW` - `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-110X_mcRun4_realistic_v2_2026D49noPU-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW` I did not see LogErrors of invalid stubs. #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: Backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30909.::here ...::... and here.::Yes, the half-strip stagger was supposed to have been fixed in 11_1_X.

Yesterday, @jainshilpi asked me about running VID for `reco::GsfElectrons` in 10_6_X, which is a requirement by her analysis if I understood correctly. This is not supported by the EgammaPostRecoTools [1]. It is actually a bit dangerous because if one forgets to update the GsfElectron format, the ID will silently give wrong results. Hence, we naturally started discussing about https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30052, which added a protection against running on the wrong DataFormat and also a configuration to update the GsfElectron format. Both @jainshilpi and @swagata87 were advocating a backport of this PR to the widely used 10_6_X release. We would not have to worry about a possible wrong use of the Electron ID in 10_6_X anymore. This backport was fortunately almost trivial, except for some very minor manual fixes in `MVAValueMapProducer.h` due to the absence of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/26814 in 10_6_X. The original PR also contains a more detailed quantification of how forgetting to update the DataFormat affects the MVA values and efficiencies: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30052#issuecomment-643824398 Thank you very much for considering this!

Tests in this PR are showing no differences, but perhaps 100 events are note enough to encounter an inf/nan in the now modified variables. To be pedantic, another flag (```bool catch_infs``` or similar) is needed (master first, then backport).

I assume @hqucms left this in originally for 106X because he observed some difference on some sample of events (unless he was just being extremely careful?).

I was initially worried about this, but in my own tests with ParticleNet I found 0 difference (granted it was only ~10k BulkGrav->HH->4b and ~10k ttbar events) were these tests done in 106X or in the master/112X, which has/had more catch_infs already in place.::106X. ::The `catch_infs` were not added to the `use_puppiP4_` case in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29062 mainly to preserve the old behavior for DeepAK8. We observed some nan values in the DeepAK8 outputs and eventually it was tracked down to this part, so we added the `catch_infs` in the master branch and also for ParticleNet in the backport https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29062. I actually would be in favor of adding `catch_infs` for all cases if we are OK to make a small exception to the no-change policy (which only affects a very small fraction of DeepAK8 outputs that are currently nan).::>  @hqucms @jmduarte what is the expected response to an inf/nan in the inputs made by this module to the inference taggers? please clarify::@slava77 I believe @hqucms is saying the previous behavior is that the tagger would output nan if any input was nan/inf.

Restructured code of againstElectronDeadECAL discriminator to run on either AOD or miniAOD inputs: - add a version of the discriminant to run on top of pat::Taus to be used with miniAOD data samples; - use eta and phi of impact position of the leading PFChargedHadron on ECal surface instead of eta and phi of tau at the vertex (taking bending of track in the magnetic field and the zVertex into account); it can be disabled for backwards compatibility; - restructure the code in the way that AOD and miniAOD versions of the discriminant are just different instances of the same template code; - move code preforming extrapolation to the ECal surface from the againstElectronMVA algorithm to an auxiliary helper class which avoids code duplication; - add output of the againstElectronDeadECAL discriminant produced at AOD (already present in RECO/AOD workflow) to `slimmedTaus` in MiniAOD Expected some differences: - small difference in output of PFRecoTauDiscriminationAgainstElectronDeadECAL (AOD) discriminant because of enabled extrapolation to the ECAL (version with the extrapolation disabled gives identical results as one before the changes in this PR); - new tauID embedded into slimmedTaus in miniAOD. #### PR validation: Tested several times during review of original PR basing on the same development branch. #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: It is backport of #29627 (actually it uses exactly same development branch as the original/mother PR)::,5cdb02e9ae6aebfa48794c27176125462d24eeff::e6bfb8f5eddb5508c60f1318b29d75a6bf2b87c9::fb541811c17f5549a2b8429e674c346aa8295510::2cf9a25a1f595d04e9d12eab8bec93d1d5156dbe::6cc80e12e1fe44d185b4ab70da8f5d1f7a8b93de::08cc970a4f84bc7cf20cd9c604c5140021b2b4b9::d1e19f2b7d3ebbc9a84cc00e50914718ad7f3795::407f38cab5afb10dc6af27c73a465e04903feab3::5c27ac19cbcac0413a09e5c70461907b9c790007::84762b7b9999e9239444467d40cba6cf3d13bca1::

[1]  As it turns out the emulator was not accessing the 2016 Global Tag conditions for most of the algorithm settings, creating a mix of 2016 and 2018 logic which is internally inconsistent.  Efe measured the efficiency in the latest RelVal samples (see attached slides), and due to this bug it is 10% lower in the negative endcap than in the positive. Thankfully the fix is quite simple, as you can see in this pull request.  Efe's plots confirm that the efficiency looks good when re-running the newest RelVals with this patch applied, and is consistent with the efficiency in 2016 data. [2] For historical background on the likely cause for this bug, between 2016 and 2017 we completely overhauled the EMTF emulator, in part to handle the new RPC inputs.  Unfortunately both the CondDB code and payloads for EMTF at that point were in disarray (very long story), and accessing the conditions payload was crashing the MC RelVals.  At that point (if my hazy memory serves) we decided to configure by firmware version only for data, and by ""fake conditions"" for MC, with 3 different ""fake conditions"" python config files.  Sometime subsequently the ""fake conditions"" for each year went away, so the MC emulation (again, for some but not all of the algorithm settings) used the default settings, instead of the time-dependent firmware version settings.  This worked fine when the ""default"" settings were also the ""current"" settings (which was true when the 2017 and 2018 MC were produced), but fails for 2016. re-emulation.  Long story short, our workflows had never been fully validated for legacy MC, and now we're finding the bugs - for which we apologize.

See that thread for more info on the expected changes. This probably has cropped up a few times now, and might happen again in the future. We plan to move away from the hard-coded crate-FED map. A couple ideas: 1. Change from FED to something like RBX. HCAL ops doesn't like FED anyways, since it doesn't correspond to anything physical and is subject to change in the future (depending on the zero-suppression strategy at higher radiation damage, HCAL may move to 3 FEDs / crate). 2. Make FED available through conditions. Seems like a lot of work just to have FED on a plot axis. #### PR validation: Fixes the crash in playback.

The general goal is to switch to PUPPI tune v13 for the UL-re-MiniAOD in Summer (this PR comes later). Until then we would like to use this customizer to produce JetMET-specific-NanoAODs (custom_jme_cff) with PUPPI tune v13 for validation and calibration. The PR also adds puppi weighted multiplicity observables to JetMET-specific-NanoAODs. The PR also drops an unnecessary call of photon ID in PUPPI MET computation that is not used anymore (and was already dropped in CMSSW_11_X). The most recent presentation of the performance of PUPPI v13 is here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/876142/#5-update-on-puppi-tuning #### PR validation: It was checked that slimmedJetsPuppi and slimmedMETsPuppi are modified as expected and the corresponding JetMET-specific-NanoAOD entries change accordingly using workflow 10824.0 with this customizer: cmsDriver.py step6  --conditions auto:phase1_2018_realistic -n 10 --era Run2_2018 --eventcontent NANOEDMAODSIM --filein file:step3_inMINIAODSIM.root -s NANO --datatier NANOAODSIM --geometry DB:Extended --customise_commands ""from CommonTools.PileupAlgos.customizePuppiTune_cff import UpdatePuppiTuneV13; UpdatePuppiTuneV13(process); from PhysicsTools.NanoAOD.custom_jme_cff import PrepJMECustomNanoAOD; PrepJMECustomNanoAOD(process)"" --fileout file:step6.root  > step6_TTbar_13+TTbar_13TeV_TuneCUETP8M1_2018_GenSimFull+DigiFull_2018+RecoFull_2018+HARVESTFull_2018+ALCAFull_2018+NanoFull_2018.log #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: This is needed for JetMET-specific-NanoAOD production to derive calibrations for UL16/17/18.::Is it then still needed to ```import setupPuppiPhoton,setupPuppiPhotonMiniAOD```?::What is this loading needed for?

The updates contained in this PR will be included in the 10_6_X 2016 UL production and the changes have already been merged in master. A 10_6_X backport PR will be prepared as well. I'm not certain that an 11_0_X backport is strictly necessary as no 2016 production campaign is planned for 11_0_X; the 10_6_X backport is more important. But since these changes will be used in both 11_1_X and 10_6_X, it seems less confusing to have the changes in 11_0_X as well. Since this PR is mainly intended for the bookkeeping of sensible default values for RelVal workflows, I will let PdmV experts decide if they want it merged in 11_0_X as well. #### PR validation: The changes have been validated within the 2016 10_6_X UL campaign: https://indico.cern.ch/event/865993/#15-tracker-on-ul-16 In addition, a technical test was performed: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited,7.22 --ibeos` #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: This PR is a backport of PR #28624.::",0a631531c4515c71a1bb06e390afe80ee990faef::d489055e170690e1a5c89a8ce4c3d20a566094c3::f708ac4fe58f3c4823e55aaf7f4f6bf11159742c::91b815572cb7944ee7ef921c7d09086b3318b2ef::bd785defe3807cb605d29c9e76eba5107ff93aa5::c6a7b472eba1bbf750fd6f9cfc49a08fd96ffef1::

It shouldn't impact Run2 and Run3 reconstruction, but improves phase2 reconstruction. Before this PR, tracks and HF clusters in |eta|=3-4 region have been heavily double-counting charged particles in this region, which will be largely remedied in this PR. This PR introduces kdtree-based linking between tracks and HF clusters, and links are utilized in mostly createCandidatesHF of PFAlgo. Also, the propagator is fixed to make the track propagation to HF to work for particles with pt<3 GeV also (which was broken in the past, as it didn't matter). Also, the HF face is updated to be in agreement with the actual geometry. #### PR validation: See the original PR #28442 #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: This is a backport of #28442 ::",2237467c71efeaffbee9e8f1c79bc9cc32fe70de::2557e10504f9dc64189d9d8c8e5693f35a097385::593175c2089971c7faf3e2e8118f7269b156c034::d50cff3a78a829ec34e5655a8271e7826182d915::8cc3b6a9df261694f1ce39f16705c218cf0acf70::c9d4a475e05027e35959433ff9a9b68a826be43b::3efc28de93209f60132cc47299e3aa7b049d90d0::8e81828223c7a411294f7845218e9fa79bd52bb7::95fb6d40a968a8a51fb7e49228aba8632529187f::6e4003d57b085d89d349fbb4ffafb2ef43be4b12::eacdbc76575bafa72cfef625dabf8119c929bf03::479009baa20c008a6280f9a66d71fd7f274fece5::2555a42251a8b7371d2c4b90e8317bbd7cb9072d::366c15289e75907ed1c006c1bb4a434209e986d9::18a1727cdef17f905c8760e064120ffd4755d9e8::8c89b49ee9fa0245ddcae324526862a14561520f::fc37708f571b725db3865f4763fe2e604e04ed91::ed14398085e5ffa3386846855d9bcc76f00f452c::fb4822e6df9c148f6ae8c51ea2e9e9e7caddcc9f::16c87820349de76ec10d9450f43ff23c37c07fa6::2485ea4f8041636d7f42a23dddeebb0936e5f372::13a2c4b5df352fe8c82688dcccb7e020481599b6::639aba3c1b1eaa38d1e777a72038e66c34ae17e3::67c05105eb4dfd72d37f73cdda115f923cff7660::c0b4cd073b855977ab32ed7643cfc2cd44f1925b::028495a58a5b368fc7be575f764fa6f124ab6060::b9f559cd6b5a187e314594feced469cef2911ad2::a53683c895b7de06c10f0b094ea9047f0dc1e7e7::d1e6a741ae23c342c2fbbcced496c4e789cb713a::1981ab140b1b55b994432580002302245c72e6dd::020db585ce60d1fee870595857ce184673cd1fa2::b4d88a8e94c1da4b1105ae02b3b1b2b295827c89::b07fda179a847f1098c4db203176944e5a6867aa::

It includes: - a tool for trend plots (hence, the data/ folder and additions in test/plottingTools) - a way to change marker styles and colors for result plots - a way to add the number of hits in a sector to result plots - fix to a small typo in test/batch/startSkim.py - fix to the wrong ideal alignment being loaded in test/cfgTemplate/apeEstimator_cfg.py - additional functionality for test/autoSubmitter: * Basic support for submitting to condor ""CAF queue"". * Protection against cases where the condor scheduler is unavailable when submitting jobs which used to cause crashes. Now, in this case the submission is retried after some waiting time until it works. * Support for running multiple threads to handle measurements in case of large campaigns. Before, it happened that condor jobs (that do the track refits) of  measurements finished while another measurement was being handled, so that there was some delay before these measurements were handled, which piled up to longer delay when doing many measurements. * Some minor changes like putting some functions into helper.py and introducing new shortcuts for convenience. #### PR Validation: The validation happened while using the tool.

This feature was up to now nominally switched off for the the Phase-0 detector and it is hereby activated by means of the era mechanism. A new modifier `Configuration/Eras/python/Modifier_pixel_2016_cff.py ` is introduced and used in the definition of the `Era_Run2_2016` to selectively switch on the feature only for 2016 which is targeted by the Ultra-Legacy. An appropriate set of 2D template conditions for the radiation damage model has been derived together with update CPE conditions (Simulation Lorentz Angle, Lorentz Angle offset calibration, generic errors and 1D templates), using the third IOV of the data conditions as an approximation of the ""average"" radiation damage in 2016. They are proposed in this PR, by updating several `autoCond` keys with candidate Global Tags: * `run2_design`:  https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2_design_v5/106X_mcRun2_design_v6 * `run2_mc`: https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v5/106X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v6 * `run2_mc_cosmics`: https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v2/106X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v3 * `run2_mc_pa`: https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2_pA_v4/106X_mcRun2_pA_v5 **N.B.**: in the design MC case only the 2D template tags are changed using the same payload both at the `numerator` and `denominator` label, resulting in no re-weigthing applied (design is assumed to be unirradiated). ~~If AlCa/DB can make these full-fledged Global Tags I will be gladly updating the autoCond file.~~ #### PR validation: The PR passes standard tests (`addOnTests` and ```runTheMatrix.py -l limited -t 4 -j 8```. Additionally the effect of the charge re-weighting has been tested in simulation by comparing the pixel charge profiles vs depth with two 2016 runs 278240 & 278308 ( falling into IOV 3  of the data CPE conditions) and the reference MC without re-weighting. The comparison is shown [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/808419/contributions/3509501/attachments/1884963/3106810/ccp_2016ULprep_reweighting_newTemplate.pdf) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/61814570-a45dcd80-ae48-11e9-9c98-d9d3d7b8366f.png) Post-reweighting DATA and MC profiles are found in satisfactory agreement. #### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: backport of #27600 cc: @tsusa @tvami @leaca ::",5ba3b3a86baeca8c9010c2c6bbd69f4f0bbb2678::577dbe7251078c201e03024264ef878f0b66ee6d::a587267c563f59cabc6ab67c50f23546bd669f12::57ac1ea0a0acab5f10257d1687294747cedf4486::788cb84d6bfe5cbe1ecba0008f9605fdf8d82685::

It relies on cms-sw/cmsdist#4691 (produced for 102X). In summary, the PR: - completes the low pT electron chain by adding new modules and extending in a minor way the functionality of the existing Seeding module; - does not introduce any new DataFormat and simply reuses existing ones; - adds new collections to the Event; - does not alter any of the default EGamma code and workflows, - integrates within the miniAOD workflows, - relies on a new BDT model for ID purposes, found in [this](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification/pull/12) PR. The modified existing modules are: - ```LowPtGsfElectronSeedProducer```: this producer is minimally extended to produce a ValueMap<PreIdRef> indexed by an ElectronSeedRef. The PreIds hold the discriminator outputs of the BDT models used by this producer but the PreIds cannot be accessed directly from the GsfElectrons and related interfaces, while the ElectronSeeds are accessible. Hence this ValueMap allows the ```LowPtGsfElectronSeedValueMaps``` module to link the BDT output from the Seeding module to electrons, details below. The new modules are: - ```LowPtGsfElectronSCProducer```: A new ""tracker-driven"" SuperCluster producer, seeded by extrapolating the low pT GsfTracks and brem trajectories to the ECAL. - ```LowPtGsfElectronCoreProducer```: this straightforward module produces GsfElectronCore objects and borrows heavily from the standard EGamma code. - ```LowPtGsfElectronProducer```: this straightforward module produces GsfElectron objects and borrows heavily from the standard EGamma code. - ```lowPtGsfElectronSeedValueMapsProducer```: This module consumes GsfElectrons and the ValueMap from the ```LowPtGsfElectronSeedProducer``` module. It produces two ValueMap<double> indexed by a GsfElectronRef that contain the BDT discriminator values. - ```LowPtGsfElectronIDProducer```: this module consumes GsfElectrons and makes use of a BDT model to ID the electrons, i.e. discriminate genuine electrons from fakes. The XML  description of the model can be found in [this](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification/pull/12) PR to the cms-data repository. - ```miniAOD``` integration: modifications to the ```PhysicsTools/PatAlgos``` package allow to produced a slimmed low pT electron collection.

The version of the input RelVal to be used is not the default one, but the override mechanism added for the upgrade version is not directly applicable to the standard relval workflows because they are added with a different syntax. Here the dataset stored in the desired element of the dictionary is extracted, modified according to the predefined input dictionary ""overrideFragment"", and the dictionary element is re-created with the new definition. Verified to solve the pending issue when running the command runTheMatrix.py -i all -t 4 -l 250204.18.

Currently in the Heavy Ion runs, we are seeing ~30% data-emulator disagreement in the Online DQM: https://tinyurl.com/ydzbs6wf For this to work, the most recent change to the external conditions in L1Trigger/L1TMuon/data (pulled into the ""master"" branch on September 25 [1]) must be in CMSSW_10_3_1.  @rekovic , @thomreis , or anyone else: do you know how to see what external conditions are included in a given CMSSW release? If these externals are not there yet, I'll have to make another commit to modify this branch, so that it will work for the DQM.

I defined the variables in that scope since they are necessary only to fix the z axis range when working with the average of the mass distribution and not the standard deviation. Can you be more specific regarding the issue you noticed? Thanks in advance, Andrea::Hi Andrea, I counted the parentheses wrong  -my bad. Still I am wondering about the blank stripe you showed in the middle of the sigma distribution during the meeting (see also comment at line https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25159/files/88635fbdd021ffe44198e59bc13b66a59ecca03f#diff-b7a5bcf180f203de7abd9bb4d084e665R370). In the case of the sigma which rangeuser is applied? None? ::Hi Marco, no range is set for the sigma distribution, the plots are identical to what you would observe in the BiasCheck.root file drawing the histograms with the colz option. I'm investigating the code in CompareBiasZValidation.cc [1] to try and understand what causes the problem, as of now I did not find anything weird... Anyway I put the comment you underlined in the code as a reminder that there is still work to be done, then I decided to make the pull request anyway given that some features can already be used in the framework.

Not exactly. But that's a good idea. Also, please make sure your commit description offers an explanation of the change you're applying and make sure it is unique. Right now I see you have three different commits with the same description. It is better to avoid 'Merge' commits, check `git rebase`::Thank you very much for the tip, I'll implement the change.

This ID is not supported anymore and we only noticed it during the preparation of the Fall17 V2 ID backport to 9_4_X. It is not enabled by default, that's why we didn't catch this in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24131. Even thought it's a deprecated ID, I think it's not appropriate to let it break in the 10_3_0 release in this ungraceful way, so I hope I'm still in time... My personal validation workflow shows now agreement of the Spring15 photon MVAs between this PR and 9_4_9. Jonas::",06ada0c1ee8b702db376178fa448ec577f722dd4::

Thus, a pixel template matches each pixel resolution histogram file.  [This is very important for Phase 1 Forward, since the blades are tilted about both axes, and thus the angles are different from Phase 0 geometry.] - pixel templates are loaded from the DB. - the current code is essentially completely generic, and will work for Phase2 as well.

These scans are not affecting physics  (so they are standard production runs) and therefore normally only standard `AOD` output is available for the high rate (ie. non commissioning) datasets, which is not enough for the sensor aging monitoring purposes. A viable solution would be to run one of our `ALCARECO` producers saving tracks and Strip clusters , but this solution might be in general disfavored  due to concerns about output dataset size. Since we are scanning only few (fixed) power groups in a small bias scan and we are interested only in the clusters of tracks that have at least one hit on one of the modules being scanned, and we could select the output tracks to drastically reduce the data throughput. This is what has been implemented in the PR. A new track selector `CalibrationTrackSelectorFromDetIdList`, allowing to save a collection of track candidates leaving hits through a certain list of Tracker modules is employed in the novel `SiStripCalSmallBiasScan` `ALCARECO` producer. The new `ALCARECO` producer has been added to several 2018 matrix workflows, including wf 136.85 which is in the short list used in PR tests. To allow the `ALCARECO` producer to run I have changed the `AlCaRecoTriggerBits` in the `run2_data_relval` and `run2_data_promptlike`  autoCond keys with temporary candidate GTs. @lpernie @tocheng you might want to change them into full-fledged Global Tags. I report here for completeness the average compressed size in bytes/event of the branches of the new `ALCARECO` compared with `SiStripCalMinBias`. | Branch name | `SiStripCalMinBias` | `SiStripCalSmallBiasScan` | | ------------- | ------------- |------------- | |recoTrackExtras                  |39791      |1982.09  | |TrackingRecHitsOwned             |27896.9    |1505.75  | |recoTracks                       |24399.7    |1160.07  | |SiStripClusteredmNewDetSetVector |22430.6    |1043.46  | |SiPixelClusteredmNewDetSetVector |13553.5    |1001.83  | |LumiScalerss_scalersRawToDigi    |1179.33    |951.02	| |EventProductProvenance           |1004.8     |786.41	| |DcsStatuss                       |349.09     |310.52	| |L1AcceptBunchCrossings           |217.85     |196.37	| |edmTriggerResults                |192.13     |181.04	| |DetIdedmEDCollection             |158.74     |144.52	| |edmTriggerResults                |127.18     |118.99	| |edmTriggerResults                |71.18      |63.34	| |L1GlobalTriggerReadoutRecord     |63.36      |56.98	| |EventAuxiliary                   |56.24      |52.17	| |EventSelections                  |28.55      |24.4	| |BranchListIndexes                |17.88      |15.5     | ::",eae1111894e8f8a18438ad64fab8905e9bb0b0c8::1025af94d1651412ead139ba448581028d13e924::5ea2130e14809911bd200d3f624c5bd6be4d37f1::925da52c4eff48f26263dd90a735f84fb3fde033::

This PR activates the offline emulator DQM for the L1T. Since the calo layer2 emulator needs the data of validation events it cannot run in the offline DQM from unpacked calo layer2 digis. Instead we run the calo layer1 + layer2 emulator chain to get the emulated caloLayer2 objects without the need for unpacked layer2 inputs (https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-418). In addition the emulated L1T objects offline DQM (efficiency and resolution) is added.::,f7f0867d6653fa31c5b5a12676cf727a525a041f::4fa6aef21cb83fe67ef53e16a4e86be84fc10945::27d6108418101c40f924645744d1ae406ceae99b::9fe0da7d5e0d8de9ae3ea593f73bad463a0b5938::2d782d7682120c792bd83b7cad74e29433ff610f::ea4951b60f3a481337ad5241f26a183c33ecd584::9fa0eb034a33c7f876319711500de0e13c4c24d1::32d3610756049afda9730385d37aa9163809266c::

This PR consists of three commits: b3856d6 fixes a small typo in one of the rarely used macros for validation plots. 33f7b47 consists of an update to the SkimProducer and AlignmentTrackSelector on one hand to ease the configuration of skims. On the other hand, a new python script startSkim.py was created to use alternatively to skimProducer.bash. This new script enables parallel execution of skims as well as automatic renaming of the output files (from *00N.root to *_(N+1).root which is the input name format needed for the APE measurements) and moving of the skimmed files to a target directory. e43f208 adds additional optional input parameters to the central _cfg.py files used for a measurement. When using the standard workflow, these parameters are unused and nothing changes. However, the commit also includes a new folder autoSubmitter which includes a script to configure and submit multiple measurements at the same time in order to be able to do multiple measurements at once using only one CMSSW-environment.::",b3856d67bcb116fef8b152b2c537e75b26db8125::33f7b478f01a9a855c679f2c135c9e087bab19e4::e43f2086fb22d54f0c4a87c79bc67d05ec624cf7::

One could think of explicitly calling a constructor ```emplace_back(CastorRecHit(...```, but that's the same as what it is now. the old implementation collected copies of the hits (type CastorRecHit). The updated version does exactly the same. and also avoids a memory leak that was there before. ::No, using `new` here is totally unnecessary and in fact it's a memory leak. `rec` is a `CastorRecHitCollection` and it can construct the `CastorRecHit` objects from arguments using `emplace_back()`.::@hvanhaev please remind me the reason for hits with the ```id().module() <= 2``` to be not handled in a special way anymore. Are hits with these module values present only for some period of data taking. If so, when? ::@hvanhaev In case you missed the question, please clarify on the hits with ```id().module() <= 2``` ::@hvanhaev: (maybe I missed some part of the discussion about it, sorry for that) shouldn't this 0.5 factor for ```id().module() <= 2``` be restored to fully reproduce the previous 80X behaviour? ::https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23894#issuecomment-409218432 this code is not used in the standard reco workflows.

For the backport to 10_1_X, modifications were made to simEmtfDigis_cfi.py such that the default EMTF emulator config matched the 2017 performance, for purposes of MC production.  However, SectorProcessor.cc assumed that the default config was 2018, so when configuring via the firmware version from O2O, it made no changes to the config.

This in turn entailed that if there was a movement exceeding the thresholds the DQM monitoring was crippled (all the other alignable parts were not plotted). I introduce a new boolean to decide whether to veto the upload, still not breaking the loop (so that all parts are plotted) * a bug in `MillePedeDQMModule.cc` causing the thresholds on several parameters for `theta_Z` alignable to be taken instead from the `theta_Y`.

The request is summarised in the following JIRA ticket: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-329 The code allows for the comparison of the corresponding standard BX collections: Muon, EGamma, EtSum, Jet and Tau, with those that are appended by an index ranging from 2-6, corresponding to the board number. The code re-uses the existing L1TStage2MuonComp and L1TStage2uGTCaloLayer2Comp L1T DQM modules, so the major change is the addition of a L1TStage2uGTBoardComp_cff.py configuration file fragment. For the CaloLayer2Comp module, minor changes were implemented to generalise the parameter names that are taken as input. It has no effect on the histograms produced for the CaloLayer2 output vs uGT input comparisons (apart from the histogram title). This additional data is read-out for validation events only, so the DQM module runs in the validation sequence only. Relevant to this PR is the update to the uGT and CaloLayer2 unpackers, which was required to unpack this new data and fill the relevant object collections: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23257 (Backport to 10_1_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23628)::",8dfa951dd9c570fd97165ca47f546fd2eec3919a::

This data is then to be compared using a L1T DQM module, to ensure that all 6 boards receive the same information. This is summarised in the following JIRA ticket: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-329 The changes in the code allow for the unpacking of this additional data, which is filled into new BX collections that are appended by an index ranging from 2-6, corresponding to the board number. The following CaloLayer2 unpackers have been modified: EGamma, EtSum, Jet, Tau. The changes are analogous to the existing modification of the Muon unpacker, where one defines a 'copy' to be filled, which corresponds to the board number. This copy number is initialised to 0, which refers to the existing collection for the first board. The GTSetup, as well as the CaloCollections, GTCollections and L1TObjectCollections had to be updated to synchronise with these changes. It is important to ensure that these changes have no effect on the original unpacked collections, as well as do not cause any issues downstream. The code has been tested on Run2018A data and a basic comparisons of single hwPt, hwEta, hwPhi distributions indicate that there are no differences and that the new collections are correctly filled. However, this does not serve as a complete validation of the code. The results of these tests are attached together with the JIRA ticket in the form of slides. Therefore, I would kindly request for the experts to proceed with validating this code further.::",defa42733f8b591d79ec671e9f4cb6ca6843ba7b::

By default this is switched to `False`, so in normal conditions this addition is completely transparent to the validation procedure. This has been shown to be useful to cross-check the scrutiny of the Full-Track validation of the alignment payload at this [Hypernews thread](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/3668/1/1/2/2.html). See here an example of output validation plot obtained for run 31766 either in standard conditions, forcing the vertex fit with the BS from DB prior to re-computation of BS with the new alignment and forcing the vertex fit with the updated BS. ![biasescanvas_run316766forced_old_bs_vs_forced_new_bs_vs_standard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/40919596-3e6a0366-680a-11e8-8ca2-02b63890ce1a.png) I profit of this PR also to update the initialization file of the all-in-one meta-data tool adding links to the twiki documentation.::",8f696ab72166af8cf656bd12e040dc7d93f67145::927f09d7ee3e46e07bbcee19d152d8759b8557d6::f62670f1c2522ddc307adf6c16e7e47b4ced1744::e01a5b9e9b411b35afad75e8e2f4594ca7b13561::

The running of the caloLayer2 DQM module in the emulator client also results in a race condition in the DQMGUI where the histograms produced by the l1tstage2 client race against the ones from the l1tstage2emulator client. Since the later have much less events as they only run in fat events, only the ones from the l1tstage2 client are desired. With the removal of the ratio plots the l1tstage2emulator version of the histograms are not needed anymore and could be removed.::",f59c40b3b67dc3e9d16cda308cf50b43df4f4ef6::

It was reported by Htogg people that they faced problems in using 80X regression in 94X (i.e. loading an object that reloads database info and reevaluates information). This was because the EGM regression changed in 9X. So EGMPOG now plans to maintain the previous versions of regression as well. Changes done: (1)  Renamed : RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGExtraInfoModifierFromDB.cc → RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGRegressionModifierV2.cc (This contains the latest version of corrections) (2) Make a new class RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGRegressionModifierV1.cc  → This is essentially the class which has 80X regression. (3)  RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/python/regressionModifier_cfi.py → This now contains a cms.PSet named regressionModifier80X which contains all the parameters set for 80X regression. This setup has been tested on 80X root file in 94X and the reloading of database info and re-evaluating information is running fine now. Thanks, Shilpi ::",0e7319f2b1243d6b34fb3ee4ba280d02c31d73d7::

Modified files are: * RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/loadRecoTauTagMVAsFromPrepDB_cfi.py *  RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/updateHPSPFTaus.py *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/slimming/miniAOD_tools.py This modification impacts both the standard and legacy80X workflows via an updated makePatTausTask. In addition the protection to prevent the PATTauProducer from asserting when encountering requests for tauID WP that are not available on existing AOD, has been backported from 100X (*). Changed files are: *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/plugins/PATTauProducer.cc *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/plugins/PATTauProducer.h *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/producersLayer1/tauProducer_cfi.py The development has been made by @mbluj. The changes wrt to status quo are in the mvaTauID output only. Performance comparisons and more detailed comments can be checked from here (**) Please consider this PR for reminiAODv2. Cheers, Roger (*) https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21186 (**) https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/cmssw/pull/71::the name of this file requires some disambiguation. There is also updateHPSPFTaus_cff with completely different content. perhaps customiseHPSPFTausForPAT  ?::it would be less verbose to simply pass all taggers in the Task constructor arguments. ::I've followed your proposals. Cheers, Roger::all existing modules should be modified in the same file where they were defined. If I'm not mistaken, it should be happening in RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/HPSPFTaus_cff.py This will also allow for a more transparent application of the modifier for run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy and run2_miniAOD_94XFall17, e.g. with a syntax like ```python for e in [ run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy, run2_miniAOD_94XFall17]: e.toModify(hpsPFTauDiscriminationByIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLTraw, mvaName = ""RecoTauTag_tauIdMVAIsoDBoldDMwLT2017v1"", mvaOpt  = ""DBoldDMwLTwGJ"") ``` Readability can also be improved by not repeating toModify with the module name for every single variable. At a glance, it seems like exactly the same modifications are applied in both cases. For this, it may even be more straightforward to define one modifier, e.g. ```run2_tauLT2017v1_mva```, which can be added into both run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy and run2_miniAOD_94XFall17. I'd leave this for some later PR in the master branch.::similarly, modifications should be done where the module is defined, in PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/producersLayer1/tauProducer_cfi.py ::Dear Slava, I'm afraid that moving modification of tau-Ids from `miniAOD_tools.py` to the file where they are defined (`RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/HPSPFTaus_cff.py`) will change the RECO/AOD event content when RECO sequences are run with the `run2_miniAOD_94XFall17` era flag. It is what we want to avoid, no?::@slava77 I'm also not sure about the quations by @mbluj . Slava, once you clarify I'm fine to upload the change that I've already made locally. I think the change requested for tauProducer_cfi.py is safe in an case.::RECO is not supposed to run with run2_miniAOD\* modifiers.::OK, but there is not protection to use this era with cmsDriver for RECO. However, I agree that it will be misuse, and that it is generally a good practice to have a modifier where modified modules are defined. Finally, as far as I know there is not many users of taus from RECOAOD nowadays (apart validation).::Technically, there is no incompatibility issue even for RECO. The ""no change"" restriction extends to existing production eras. The production era for e.g. 2017 is Run2_2017 (alone). ::it would be nice to have this edit in the same place as where it shows up in the master branch::please add this module to hpsPFTauDiscriminationByIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLTTask in RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/HPSPFTaus_cff.py This will  minimize required knowledge of the tau reco in the miniAOD_tools. (this was a part of my https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21977#issuecomment-360923538 ``` define hpsPFTauIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLTTask in in HPSPFTaus_cff.py with 7 needed modules; add hpsPFTauDiscriminationByVVLooseIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLT only for this era ``` although the text was probably not explicit enough to say that the latter action also should be applied in HPSPFTaus_cff.py::is this commented out code needed? Please remove or add comments inline in the code why the commented out block is relevant BTW, this part was removed in the last version of the PR in the master.::removal of this line breaks compatibility for boostedTau reco for all eras. I do not consider this change an obvious bugfix addressing something that was completely broken. So, I propose to either reinstate this ""modifiers.remove"" or to apply it only to the new eras for which this PR is expected to be used in this 94X release (run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy, run2_miniAOD_94XFall17)::please use a leading underscore here so that this module does not propagate downstream for ```import *``` ```_hpsPFTauDiscriminationByIsolationMVArun2v1DBoldDMwLTTaskExt```::",2acbc55a98be77533b770872bb31739c934c7888::7b92b269411891f7994ed848f295dd0e4ba24307::0ed49f82197ea5fb5c8cf6d52b8e1c05b339e4c7::1c6de2ea1e9e1b4fc29c6b529b5e2ca0a33b75cd::d226a9e5c35d06c02a9f6cb8971db2c4276f46dc::143a4df73d9ab1825b85f3b899f5e03d0f6cbde9::b0948e505d7bfcd7728ca76866ba5faac1d37704::72ca8c51c92caf8f64f920d62970200ce7da8d73::6b2d8cca16b338fbdd1c31a7ba269938c8d7127e::a997d051584b0b679ab8631cafc7162af7f4f310::e8f62d5ea0485476d5e49afb7ed31ca86641ea14::3f87478f1c8d5a5b52e78212a7e35fed221d086d::fc152ecee2dfcf163eaebd7258cca4a75a6f4d0f::b81d07a9eed1a38a79208bbfda86e10d98b1295a::03d40287a2afbaf6dd6d952ca102110d2806d9ef::3ab9cbb97cf21902b9f119df54083769a4f0a806::f8cf5c0a69d826208042fcdef09cb2b7b26ea024::551345e85c098f76ed39845b5bfac407149371cb::99d14f70ca481df20164ae35b5385add9a7a250e::54259b49beb0e330940c314cbd9f711e7b167d7b::dfc35f4f86be3489452e8fd00039da47a7ccc937::7dd4c2d3dfd537e5b680bc6887189d37454c543e::7ac37bb5abc5cf6e6a363aed6a665e620592d289::6b0ac6625c91501ed184b6bcff98c604cfb22ae5::65c5a3069d4d92dc6fe176df8b78f32c2768a4f4::d0977c8341aaad271cd311264f057148a322ba4e::b5f1c48040411295d099958bdca1644dd499dd8b::4554941087c69c6f3a9a62e0e3f32e496d2ba56e::a0f95ce38a15c713f8f08d2177176d4cf95b0f94::47d0d032e42877aeceb1f1dba07d394a58613b87::262f483ef2d17f968b17cf4d28022947a84378ad::b5834c078ca998c3acf0f9d3beff6e0502acdd6b::baffd683dd134233b655e82dc960ce6bbdb45c94::e30e6ef9a09bad18cf8813ff9ba8cfd18c3ff308::

Since elastic scattering is used for CTPPS calibration (alignment, optics), many of the new plots are of general interest for CTPPS. We would like to test the code in online DQM on 8 Nov 2017 when the machine plans a test run at 900 GeV. That's why this backport has been prepared. Some code refinements may occur after the test run. The code has been prepared such that the new plots can be easily disabled - by removing this python config line: https://github.com/jan-kaspar/cmssw/blob/dqm_rp_elastics/DQM/CTPPS/python/ctppsDQM_cff.py#L19 This PR can be tested with https://github.com/jan-kaspar/cmssw/blob/dqm_rp_elastics/DQM/CTPPS/test/elastic_dqm_test_cfg.py which uses data from a CTPPS alignment run (July 2017) where also vertical RPs were inserted. A similar Roman Pot configuration is expected for the 900 GeV data. Beyond the new DQM modules, this PR makes a minor change to the RP geometry: verticals in unit 220-fr are placed in a similar distance from beam as other vertical RPs.::",b763f849658d3899b4782464e1e8561ad9db263b::25aa06d0383560d11a82e38f7fb23b07330d601e::faf50c681bdef3132095f43d7424dd69263499ff::5d2a6ce188d9575b36750ce69deffd7e8ea52f40::bfe4c6c20432319af5d5f996e65e350c7f58289a::

These flags are needed to study the impact of the SR thresholds on the pi0/eta reconstruction from low energy photons. The change affects HLTrigger/special/src/HLTRechitsToDigis.cc HLTrigger/special/BuildFile.xml (the HLT configuration for the pi0/eta stream paths will have to be modified as well adding some parameters) The source file implements the producer that saves the digis collection in the stream output (only those digis matched to rechits used to build pi0/eta are saved). Similarly, the change we implemented takes the SrFlags collection and produce a new collections storing only the flags matched to digis that are finally kept in the stream output. The BuildFile.xml must have a new line to include a header used by the source. Tested from release CMSSW_9_2_12_patch1 running the (updated) HLT configuration on HLTPhysics dataset. The new collections are created and stored in the output dataset.

Description of original PR: > This PR adds primary vertex resolution via the vertex splitting method to tracking DQM. The resolution is measured separately for the first vertex in the given collection (a clone of `goodOfflinePrimaryVertices` by default) and for the other vertices.

The front-end chip (HPTDC) configuration has been optimized during the commissioning of the detector. The main modification was the introduction of a delay (digital) for the different channels to temporally align them. This allows a better visualization of the online data: for instance all peaks in the leading edge plots are aligned. Therefore, it was possible to reduce the acquisition window from 5 clock cycle down to 2. Drastically reducing the possibility of 2 hits in the same event. Out of those 5 time slices, the one synchronized with the trigger (centralOOT) was moved from 4 to 1 and then to 0 (first acquired slice). Some parameters require the modification of the DQM code; moreover, the readability of some plots has been improved (showing percentage instead of absolute values) and some new plots have been introduced, as the hit map in the last lumisection to immediately spot problems with the detectors. Also, code has been improved (switch case removed, NULL -> nullptr, histogram binning optimized). Finally, this code is compatible with the upcoming geometry update (UFSD implementation). Note about urgency: current version of the DQM is enough to understand if the detector is working, but not enough to show its performance online.::",737e4610acd1a18826a31de821dd1c4ce2b7bc32::a09f6ef7dc7aab4e2bf0dcc939ee16caea4c3146::7d02cea1f31cac7f8bb70e265a4e7a7d24393901::420ff694d69da6da45106d0179d12ae6783919fb::7ddfa750d54070f98f83f6adf85816f785f29d00::5c8d3a6d1f21393d7642a06ebf5b980b20ed5f2a::f8c754d16717a09f0ccd340365032d9314f49aaa::

It heals a simultaneous attempt to write in the same `/nfshome0/dqmpro/BeamMonitorDQM/BeamFitResults.txt ` file. @vanbesien @arunhep @sarafiorendi @sikler::I'm lost a bit in which set of changes provides a fix. The PR description mentions a problem of overwriting a file. This change, if the outTxt existed already will overwrite now, while it was going to append in the previous version. this seems to contradict the PR description::what is the purpose of this: how can a file not be open in the current context given that it's the first access to the file after the above calls ```C++ if (!append) outFile.open(fileName.c_str()); else outFile.open(fileName.c_str(),std::ios::app); ``` was the bug due to concurrent writing to the same file from multiple threads? if so, then this doesn't seem like the right thing to fix the problem.::the origin of the problem comes from duplicating the file handling in the printer function, here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/interface/BeamSpotWrite2Txt.h#L22-L27 while this is already done here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/src/BeamFitter.cc#L636-L639 ============== As long as the outfile is used in append mode, everything is normal. The problem showed up because, when the append option is not enabled, and this only happens for DIP, the outfile is first open here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/src/BeamFitter.cc#L636-L639 then reopened by the printer function here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/interface/BeamSpotWrite2Txt.h#L22-L27 the beam spot fit results are written, and then the file is closed here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/interface/BeamSpotWrite2Txt.h#L55 but then, back in the main BeamFitter.cc file, there's a concurrent attempt writing into the same file here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/src/BeamFitter.cc#L690-L701 Now, the idea is that the printer function does not need to handle the creation/closure and write mode of the outfile and let the code that calls it do it. In this PRs the printer function receives a reference to the outfile https://github.com/rmanzoni/cmssw/blob/a5b3d276baeaf1960a577b893410cb9f09842025/RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/interface/BeamSpotWrite2Txt.h#L20 and all it does is it writes. The open/close file handling is delegated to the code that calls this function ::this may be redundant, I agree.

As a reminder the increase in event size is of ~135b/evt. I profit of this PR to add the same info also in the producer for HI data-taking. Since making this information available at ALCARECO level is rather useful to tune the event thresholds for the calibration in multi-run harvesting mode, I'd appreciate fast integration.::",0138de2212bf1a227bb7a10ca8ce13a534bbdc34::

This is take 2 of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/19548, which pulled in some unwanted commits somehow. Edit: at @dmitrijus' request, here is the comment from the original PR. - Finish protecting against inclusion of calibration channels in QIE10/11DigiCollections. These can cause crashes when FEDs 1134 and 1135 are included in runs. (The previous PRs fixed most of these, but I unfortunately discovered a few more cases.) - Add zero suppression to emulated TPs, to match what is done in data TPs. - PedestalTask has a filter to skip the laser/CRF/calibration channels crate. This was moved from crate 36 to 38, so the filter is updated accordingly (note that crate 36 is not in use anymore). - Small plot adjustments: fN_to4000 changed to fN_to8000 (this is used only to set the y-range for profile plots, so doesn't add bins), and fEtCorr_256 is changed from [-2,256] to [-1, 257] so that saturated bins aren't right on the edge. This PR does not add any extra bins. ::",77a2b749171e6b8910516b4456f867b7dbf29f39::93ccb7eaacaafaf42a46e99c78299f3679c26927::ce66c6d5fe38ef96727e77c89bb4997945cf6243::97ee78c0e39868154f811abfea2d98f80bd044ee::ebcece677bc72a528472ea0e4d658e474a8c5ce2::e0f9e4065406067301417fe1a3b5c311f7cdb868::f53d78e5b3e877631c00e496d9b2cd6dcf0293ce::5b994c05dfe9acdfe96190ccde5781df7a827e19::773417b100816d4a0056a94b4b3ff5d18761baa9::f773c836c38523d30bc50da54b4dee7d5ea90be0::573701d4d83a1f4d10d571afa58d2e63c5fbbc3d::04aef2f6a675cb11e1acebc6272eba4375e373d6::9302a3a49751eccdd462f040e4d880ac79d5a730::e4ca469c2d88f0d0539e5473e367333adbcfcce1::bbe4f57ea3db7a372e9127389a7862f556fec6b5::44515657ffc6181234eeb45c90cd5813b9fd71df::4323e644baa4e35319c1a6878322b3197bb816fb::c2654d5decdfe25a5f6fd4727234c42bb54eb4bf::d80542b0204d0322462dcf4025870530a82f7188::12dfdc688af4659cbdaf946e8fafb740ba44a74f::8c71ccaf5ecd150880aa6c05906605eb322a06cc::c8fa5be11fec25001b5203a3ce526205a716c58d::723ef714eef1d2b526e741380ba2894fda36ffbb::cc99b080840fdc87b9bf93511edfe74c20c5e3d6::062bb229f497dcafd0315f7cee847d71589ded3a::6188d603a89c7c821478f6783620ed06488586ce::33c2d756d1d68bda01998d7f10bf0d0645524b59::ff93b19a8718307a7b8cde157ec8469f8101f3f2::275487fa411bfa38727eb904ed7d56054e59263b::ab2d9e8d91727adb8c2af4a8420e21e707ed283b::c67218877eaf925bf3958c385ebcd48a682d659c::624b2c91eafb89f073a63233aa8448fa8b06f471::29235a280a8c8784bf3dd6e0c36efc99eb719b4e::d21cfb51caf8004b0164360634a7f63f364c1aef::47180aabb5bbc7d20bc08fd6317808da14acfc9a::11d10d7c753155016bb0d958c084e18d6d69cd61::0e30ab99114f260b0e102a739d530017c63dabe8::851953fc493c1cd9afeac5b73389fa5fa0a99db1::1903499efc52cef48b25514014cfead2619a7745::02298d53a3584ed744907dfc693b737e88b6ad3a::cc6c6635befb8235d90236592833872c446c7e91::8c7a3e1a2afc3e5cf934503d6ba7632651f4e518::e8565dbf45fdbc59d55d8be582ef18eb9aa6dd05::a7b3fb529646d9b46fd64a6ac1899747f4c711e2::a748bb9b033eac1d34c5ba4ebec2dc739bbadcdb::2f4a22bf5176256fd635703a21ea7c8221ce7009::8a5fb4a12e66ebffcb05a282087b20013a9f45c4::71ba28079864cd54c6680a76fc1012b0ca08b8df::a071230d858a357188834a2ed02c603e916fcf1e::dc9d9a6a9940c2bd2ba1360996a621f02a9ef2c9::d9f25b6c3b1e4aa93b1c520429af4ec8f8b9371a::e1d25ea59b3ffbb0397dc69648f9b620a4e84f58::cdd5c5f7cb183615b46a24cb1f6acebcb0146e75::7886db1c880df5abc5660b1aa9bd06fb28dbba41::850b9ba4ea30137a248eb27bbc06ef60b0bf30ba::3024ce65ea8d3f60c51246d93d9b0f8313bb3a85::192cce993cbea47d840f0749a7fef51540a80ec2::d5e7186bf3b045d87f4ff8ac06c874c6beb07235::a43e0acc974f8e7329ed09682098b902d5eb47f3::3df53c87a0a5066c6852e98677cfcc16f524d1ea::3cd0f2343a7e64856c74f42847df3743606cb276::d8875bd55515c650cce0b07d6d376ddf2f7c6023::cd4db5d670d2c787e20e5a953fd93652ac1c183b::190fa41dfb9935ff3b1808cbd5b8a27ebc1b15dd::2bdbd088e8d12c0c405befee64b6a8349c5ab1fa::90c88877f32f10d34ace6ad404c1a7591f73551a::00d71accfd825d383a19d689428e890c2c167504::8aa0326165f8ac5e4fb62d1ab17c0e620e0b3420::5caa1861336252d2bdb875974d5d658c131aca49::efaf01e960152c5b5a0ffa27d3ebb430ec784147::6ff4e2858ff2f4b226cefd1dcc337dc82ce85d08::1be37f4c414c52a12a70dc1d270dddf275dd9bf4::f2ff0a975f018b10728d077362449476a0b2ea89::9e941f1fe8db4ca06ab8ce7ec1ea5138ff680d0b::de2dc47798e137bdd97a88dddbc5fb766f273bc7::4fe3d4614a4c8642bfa2518b53e240859e7187f2::

The dasgoclient makes `validateAlignments.py -c testValidate.ini -N testValidate -n` a factor of 3 faster.

Edit: at @dmitrijus' request, here is the comment from the PR to master. A few updates: - Fix crash in RecHitTask exposed by beam splashes. For the plan-1 collapsed RecHits that do not exist in the actual detector, the HcalElectronicsId must not be used.

What else needs to be done? ::Also change the explicit cfi file in ../python to use the generated cfi file and then do the further (era?) modifications. Also,  the two files have to have different names if they have different content / values of parameters, and any cff would have to include the explicit cfi to pick up the era modifs. ::@Martin-Grunewald yes, we consider now renaming fillDescription() and importing it under old regular name ""hcaRecAlgos"" into the regular config, so that the latter will contain mostly 2017 era customization. ::@Martin-Grunewald Now the branch is updated as follows. * The `fillDescriptions` has the full definition of parameters. I used the `edmPythonConfigToCppValidation` to generate it. * The explicit cfi file `RecoLocalCalo/HcalRecAlgos/python/hcalRecAlgoESProd_cfi.py` uses the generated cfi file and has only era customization After the update, I confirmed that * `runTheMatrix.py -l 10024.0 --useInput all &` test passed without failure * The DQM plots looked at before (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/19532#issuecomment-315703078) are same * The eta of calojet is same ::Just skimming the conversation quickly it appears to me the issue has already been resolved, but just in case it helps here is a link to the documentation describing the exact syntax for VPSets in fillDescriptions functions. https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideConfigurationValidationAndHelp#ParameterSets_that_Contain_Vecto::@wddgit it would be nice to add some info about `edmPythonConfigToCppValidation` to that twiki, to assist users in cases where a python file needs to be converted to C++ for fillDescriptions().::@kpedro88 Good idea.

This is because the supercluster eta is slightly biased w.r.t to the original particles position and so distorts the matching when the electron brems. This improves our pixel matching performance and is sadly necessary for the HLT. The good news is that it only effects a module used by the HLT so can not effect RECO. For more information please see Junho Kim's presentation in E/gamma last friday (05/05/17): https://indico.cern.ch/event/613829/contributions/2581351/attachments/1454808/2244939/5.5.2017_HLTEGv4.pdf I think with this, the E/gamma HLT pixel matching finally has a good baseline and is sufficient for initial running.

Most of the code is just duplication with more than 1000 lines of redundant code, i.e. it is hard to maintain. In addition, only the PCL code is routinely tested during CMSSW software integration in workflow 1001. This PR unifies the two alignment producers by means of a common base class `AlignmentProducerBase` which provides the common implementation. `AlignmentProducer` now inherits from `AlignmentProducerBase` and `edm::ESProducerLooper`. `PCLTrackerAlProducer` is renamed to the more generic `AlignmentProducerAsAnalyzer` which now inherits from `AlignmentProducerBase` and `edm::one::EDAnalyzer`. This means easier maintenance and multi-threading friendliness. The latter applies not only to the PCL workflow, but also the offline MillePede workflow which is migrated the `edm::one::EDAnalyzer` version of the alignment producer. As a bonus, the main part of the offline alignment code is now routinely exercised during integration tests. This changes has also been presented at the [last Tracker Alignment meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/607510/contributions/2533635/attachments/1436040/2208307/Alignment-UnifiedAliProducer_CMS-TkAl_20170329.pdf).

It includes: - update of the HLT menus to Phase1 (ie. confDB /dev/CMSSW_9_0_1/) - clean up of PIon and HIon menus, as accorded with HI people - clean up of modifyHLTforEras - add of GRun2016 to test the 2016 menu. Currently it is the /dev/CMSSW_9_0_0/ menu. It will become GRun + reverse customization function, as soon as the function will be ready - update of the symbolic update to use the 'phase1_2017_realistic' - update of the input files/eras to run the phase1 menu - add 'HLT:@relval2017' cmsDriver option to peak the 2017 HLT menu and use it for the phase-1 relval production - changes in HLT addOnTests: - add validation of GRun2016 - change Era from Run_2016 to Run_2017, except for GRun2016 Open issues: - we are waiting for the reverse customization function to get a 2016-like menu from the current menu - one of the test will fail, because of a issue with EcalAlCaRecoProducers. It is caused by this line https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_9_1_X/Calibration/EcalAlCaRecoProducers/plugins/SelectedElectronFEDListProducer.cc#L309 . I strongly suspect that this code is not yet compatible with the Phase-1 pixels. I contacted HLT AlCa ( @trtomei ).

The PR introduces the DeepCSV and DeepCMVA (disabled) taggers into the RECO sequences. The PR fails at the moment due to the lack of propagation of the training files in 80X cycles. I [already contacted the admins](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/4#issuecomment-281316283) to have this solved. @slava77 , do you want me to disable the taggers and then re-inable for the legacy rereco or you prefer holding this PR until the Re-Reco release is built?::[this comment goes to 90X as well] isn't this plain TaggingVariableList as a data member a problem for (evolving) persistency? Other types like TemplatedSecondaryVertexTagInfo derive the list on the fly based on the current library values of ```enum TaggingVariableName ``` to provide consistent meaning. Here, if one decides to save ShallowTagInfo, it will become non-obviously meaningless after the TaggingVariableName enum changes. It may be worth to denote this transient or redo the storage logic.::rereco is only for data. This feature is relevant for both data and MC. AOD data and MC event content will have to remain consistent. So, these taggers will need to be configured as - additions that can be added on top of AOD on the fly for those who have to use AOD [via a recipe] - as an extra b-tagger info embedded in miniAOD jets Other data/MC asymmetric alternatives are technically possible, but do not appear the most practical. The comment in the code should probably be edited or removed completely, to be replaced by a customization method to enable it on top of AOD (unless you want the recipe to be ""edit these lines"").::same as in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/17584/files#r103841544 ::The same may apply on the other way around though. Say that there are changes to the definition of the computer/TagInfo code, it will become nearly impossible to reproduce the same results. This TagInfo stores each and every input value of the NN as they are passed to the training, making it easier to debug/reproduce the code. Having the TagInfo persistent is convenient for debugging and performance studies where one wants to store the information on file and then play around with a lightweight edm format.::OK for debugging and ""transparency"" of use. Still, this means these TagInfos can not be a part of the standard data tiers (RECO/AOD/miniAOD etc)::",94ec64fe8ecf598f0acc47e75f074ca1d3a1b4fe::206dc520e41cb817bf4aac2a9161c4247d06d6a7::1fb22aaa4e2369bff75869e7a7b3ef40a058438b::3d328ca8be9774b772ecd2acd10e8b85c9ab1e90::240b3f38074a0ad3ae2e62200a2f4c3a6ce91dba::144d2662ecff3781b728f95914c3e021b36e6d2e::51c18f20aae9c02bc1f34e6536ef5229b66e45ce::7b480fb4ca3dc613429057b4dac59ef95608ea50::1a9db01e70a59538569c575264de794e663e1752::bb35e2b762e32d7617f708a28e84e788ee04121d::d64c99772b04976dba84b340a479f42df1b45cf1::7b6ffccb65e57526f2e3791375797df206b2172a::dad96feb999b02c897bb64f193d459b6ecdd068d::5748269b0c760ce266851003650d372058958793::50a0a2e33a19bd6ddfc65ae799787fac98875e94::57c584e412d8dd15ff8afcb1908b1283ec1af717::468b374f823f76f4711e2b2fb750787f00cebf35::b5a7cb44e8a480997165188e2578817c47b11ade::dff7784fad1cebd08f5101d218c20ddd1ffaef72::75454beb8f9ede90b6cba49bd7daaf3141dd7a2e::dcda37dd5520db63ab5ad9058b3288e0dfd3c78a::a525a378a85d57c66e431fd59e93f8bde4c6821b::a8d3e6df3d4622241f0729b1d3b391a531230ad0::e02e1b4bfb15393e8379b43bf7cf45234957bc5f::95d11633eb11a65c0f5dabbeda3e8f2babb701a0::

As @Martin-Grunewald just commented, you also need to pick the specific era. eg modifyForHLTEras = eras.2017.makeProcessModifier( customizeHLTPhaseIPixelGeom )::but I did: ``` # modify the HLT configuration for the Phase I pixel geometry from HLTrigger.Configuration.customizeHLTTrackingForPhaseI2017 import customizeHLTPhaseIPixelGeom eras.trackingPhase1.toModify(fragment, customizeHLTPhaseIPixelGeom) ``` etc. ::I'd suggest to use `phase1Pixel` sub-era instead of `trackingPhase1`. The former is in all `Run2_2017`, `Run2_2017_trackingRun2`, and `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` eras, while the latter is only in the first one. More philosophically, `phase1Pixel` specifies the 2017 pixel detector, while `tracking*` are used to specify the offline tracking configuration to be run (which is, at least technically, not that much tied to a specific detector, at least between phase0 and phase1).::hi Matti, ok, so I should use `phase1Pixel` for `customizeHLTPhaseIPixelGeom`; what about `customizeHLTForPFTrackingPhaseI2017` which rewrites the tracking used in the particle flow ? .A::I'd say it depends on what exactly you want to do (or how dependent of the offline tracking configuration you want to be). If you want to run `customizeHLTForPFTrackingPhaseI2017` always when ""phase1 pixel"" is enabled, use `phase1Pixel`. Would it be sufficient, or do you want to run the customize only ""sometimes"" for phase1? (as is the case with offline tracking) ::I think we want to have a single tracking configuration for the HLT, `phase1Pixel` makes the most sense. What are (for the offline tracking) the use cases for `Run2_2017` vs `Run2_2017_trackingRun2` vs `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` ? I'm asking in case it's something we should try to support on the HLT side as well.::It's essentially about having multiple tracking configurations integrated and maintained (current phase1 use cases are mainly comparison reference purposes). * `Run2_2017` is the default being run in RelVals (could be called ""production version""). * `Run2_2017_trackingRun2` runs the 2016 tracking on phase1 detector (works technically even if the 4th layer is not used in seeding). * `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` has a tracking close to the phase1 TDR (or phase2 TP PU70) #16911 will (after an update coming later today) remove `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` (*) and add `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1CA` (**). (*) TDR tracking was useful during the year but is not needed longer (**) later CA seeding will be made the default, and what we have now in `Run2_2017` will be put to some `Run2_2017_trackingX` era.::Please remove one of the `%` in the above line - I had to do so for 90X in #17096 as otherwise the generated py file does not compile...::",63a7bfc2fccbfb7e243924948c3b084871bd987d::afae5ceaf3a022dd18b95616042106e384324d1e::5b4cba2a3c9aabf2088a962e5f3d2f5c3b9352dd::2a43fa1a125106cbf550e75a47c095a9d716bd20::f95dc506b88eb6f945131ac502f48a4a322b4a2a::1bc314119939c81f46108940e64c76085b06c344::

In 75X for pp reference run we ended up making edits in the actual release. Given that special settings are applicable to both data and MC, it is more appropriate to have them set up using eras. Before deleting customise_PPwithHI, I checked that the resulting config is the same with the customise and with the era on top of the corresponding parent era (Run2_25ns + customisePPrecoForPeripheralPbPb vs Run2_25ns_peripheralPbPb; and Run2_2016+customisePPrecoforPPb vs Run2_2016_pA). Current status of DataProcessing setup in 81X prevented debugging there: - https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15792 is still not resolved - and a possible alternative pkl solution was not implemented or tested @makortel @rovere @VinInn note the edits in the seeding setup PSets instead of specific iterative tk module instances.

In a normal situation we should not have displaced vertices with O(1000) tracks. So, the candidate selection will need to be updated. - main change in this PR is to skip candidates with more than 1000 tracks (in addition to some simpler cosmetics). This should be rare enough in Run2 that we can have this update in the 80X. - particleFlowBlock with up to ~1GB: here, map hash initialization was made too large - HO-to-others linking may need to be revisited to see if cases of linking 10K block elements (as happened in these events) is meaningful - the main change in this PR for PFBA is to limit the block link map reserve to 1M (this apparently  rarely ever happens even in PU200 in simulation).

Back port newly added 2015C 25ns data workflows. Also including the following fixes: - fix ""LumiList"" selection of the lumi blocks - update 2015 golden Jason file that cover 2015B+C runs. - fix HLT DQM plot filling issue for 25ns 2015c data: ""L1REPACK""=> ""L1REPACK:GT2"" 4.) replace deprecated raw input files for three 2012 data workflows: ZElSkim2012B, ZElSkim2012C, and ZElSkim2012D 5.) remove experimental dqm gui url for plots output. ::Why do we change HLT menu in 74X? ::(only for the relvals, not for production, and maybe only for 25ns) I think that moving to a more recent HLT menu would be a good idea - the usual problem is that we need to use a compatible L1 menu, and thus a different global tag... ::@Martin-Grunewald @fwyzard Right, as Andrea mentioned, it is just a temporary solution I change it here to get a compatible L1 menu, otherwise the workflows will just crash. I think you will put a separate PR similar to PR#11391 (75x) also to the 74x to update both autoCond.py and autoHLT.py to the most recent ones, am i right? ::Why was the other URL removed? Looking in CMSSW_7_6_2015-09-27-2300 that URL is still in that release. ::The test DQM gui url is stopping service on Oct. 12, and we have been requested to remove it from all 74x 75x and 76x.   PRs to 75x and 76x will come soon.  Giovanni @franzoni , could help to confirm our plan.

This is fine for run-1 because nothing will change there. For run-2 we should not use ""@"" but directly wire the menu as used in the symbolic GT, so 25ns14e33_v3 in both cases... ::And then we should also do it like this for Run-1, ie, ""run1_mc_Fake"" and ""HLT:Fake"" instead of HLT:@fake. ::@Martin-Grunewald OK, what you mean is to change ""HLT:@relval25ns"" to ""HLT:25ns14e33_v3"" to hard wire it with the ""auto:run2_mc_25ns14e33_v3"", other wise they will not consistent, am I right? ::@Martin-Grunewald Or, could we do in anther way: - use "" 'auto:run2_mc_'+autoHLT['relval25ns']  "" - at the same time, ""HLT:@relval25ns"" could this work too? ::Yes. And the same for the run-1 fastsim test, using ""Fake"". ::The problem stems from combining a floating HLT configuration `HLT:@relval25ns` with a non-floating (L1 and HLT-wise) set of conditions `auto:run2_mc_25ns14e33_v3` . We should simply make sure that `HLT:@relval25ns` matches the default conditions in `auto:run2_mc` , and not force a different L1 menu. ::Well actually we should move for the run2 fastsim test to ...mc_GRun in the GT, and HLT:GRun, as the other HLT addOn tests do run the most recent menus as well. ::OK, thanks! In summary: For run2_fastSim:  auto:run2_mc_GRun and then HLT:GRun For run1_fastSim:  auto:run1_mc_Fake  and then HLT:Fake I will do this change. ::",bf830b981da9190adae9e6f665730cb4256f19dd::f005b52ffbdac416598ea1af9e3420d81e0c4196::ba94bc20c0800c53892d9ccde4bd6c97476f764b::1133723c343534a424cf0eecef46ee558a2e8faf::b76c6eb40e69e7b81013840a2eb94914446f638e::9471f53bd8c90f461b7c04a8898524b9299e5cdd::cdd5b528baf7f1e01da42fab63c7226037893939::9b20e78114c55ad97bb6c6d9ff5535b4d2723003::5b4e17363bd1c97146dfd661e64b379c4ebd4cd1::d2d7834b7d48cd7c0944c0897c5091b54aaaab14::fbfd18beab12024fe79eecf716147127dfc0a5cf::c0fcae94ad44589fc84df8add97f5c41fbb2b656::08346122a053dc706fc8e56a2e2a25f39e977aae::3bae694dd49198630dd58da2854299128637d54f::eb61fdd10eb830399fdc90e689986b737baa099f::6765a30aa374025b9e588492980d7c59e58797a1::c0b637067224ddb249e43cdceba1a0638345a5e4::376fe1e6d92b8b3fe222a4d61d256956f6e51fc4::dd30fef8b0aa1935ed2922eed949222d6ed789ae::021b7c75352fad16e7ab12fbf18b02ded5570422::9b1e0cd3f1757d0464b8bb5f2a248a971f48ab09::303a28ef290c69eca81649520b3c7a6d883b3987::b59e94ece9a2140fb927554d5c841d169f79454a::6d3d953a8ff560c00ba3b61ec3f225949daea14d::ac166d81da7c5f1f67f895502072774a52f2f886::ce22688067833b8d9bf5eecaf03ee81942c32220::80cc469a2d3c8f9c3f6180f44d482fe4b92a49f7::50f18c237f2cebd978b37ccebe2dc20fdc7bfffc::59ce4637338583dc096cbbf6b753e417d13b52b0::5b6f60df9e0147079242a5f5761a5665b189e3ad::

MonitorElement global_me(*i); <- constructor makes an internal copy of th1 (fixed: 1) global_me.globalize() ... gme = data_.insert(global_me) <- insert calls the same copy constructor (fixed: 2) ``` global_me is used as a key (in a set) to find an actual object to work on. It is not used outside that and once the actual object is found, global_me is just left to be destroyed at the end of the loop. This is not a leak, but the TH1::Clone is just useless, since the key comparison does not depend on it. So I've implemented: 1. Special tagged constructor which does not clone the internal th1 object, and just sets it to nullptr (perfect for searching in a set). 2. Special move constructor which will move the TH1 object. The old object will have TH1 unset. This makes std::set::insert not to make a clone of TH1 internally when inserting a transient (on the stack) object. 3. Disabled the assignment operator to avoid confusion/complexity. It was never actually used and move-constructor is complex enough already. Result: running 25.0 (with 1000 events) on 8 threads: - ~300mb less memory (peak rss) - 60s faster (5%) The code runs at end of the job, so in theory, the number of events does not matter. Only the number of streams used (it shouldn't improve anything on a single stream job). Dmitrijus ::",25636c89a382831b6a68d5f32004368533710dd0::79c210da69a6c8b4411d784fe83ca8e30895a506::
