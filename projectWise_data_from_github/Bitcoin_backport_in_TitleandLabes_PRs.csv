https://api.github.com/repos/bitcoin/bitcoin,21083,createtx-same-feerate::master,0,merged,Needs backport (0.21)::Wallet::,"During coin selection, there are various places where we need to have a feerate. We need the feerate for the transaction itself, the discard fee rate, and long term feerate. Fetching these each time we need them can lead to a race condition where two feerates that should be the same are actually different. One particular instance where this can happen is during the loop in `CreateTransactionInternal`. After inputs are chosen, the expected transaction fee is calculated using a newly fetched feerate. If `pick_new_inputs == false`, the loop will go again with the assumption that the fee for the transaction remains the same. However because the feerate is fetched again, it is possible that it actually isn't and this causes coin selection to fail. Instead of fetching the feerate each time it is needed, we fetch them all at once at the top of `CreateTransactionInternal`, store them in `CoinSelectionParams`, and use them where needed. While some of these fee rates probably don't need this caching, I've done it for consistency and the guarantee that they remain the same. Fixes #19229In commit ""wallet: Use existing feerate instead of getting a new one"" (81b6a6b12b46ee351a293ae4928e815c37f193d3) Review note: this assignment is equivalent to previous `GetMinimumFee` assignment because `GetMinimumFeeRate` is always assigned to `nFeeRateNeeded` line 2810, and `nFeeRateNeeded` is always assigned to `coin_selection_params.effective_fee` on line 2896 (thanks to `pick_new_inputs` spaghetti) and because `GetMinimumFee()` is just a wrapper for `GetMinimumFeeRate().GetFee()`::In commit ""wallet: Use existing feerate instead of getting a new one"" (81b6a6b12b46ee351a293ae4928e815c37f193d3) It appears there is a change behavior here. ""Fee estimation failed"" error will now take priority over ""insufficient funds"", ""Signing transaction failed"", and other errors. It would be good to mention this in the commit message or at least say that this isn't a pure refactoring like it might seem to be (could mention the pick new inputs race condition behavior change as well).::In commit ""wallet: Replace nFeeRateNeeded with effective_fee"" (befa7ef609c977e6baa609900cedf3d41da12e53) Review notes: It is safe to set `coin_selection_params.effective_fee` here, because there is no other code except `SelectCoins` called on line 2897 and the `nFeeRet >= nFeeNeeded` branch line 2959 below which ever read `effective_fee`, and both of these pieces of code come after the place where `effective_fee` was previously set on line 2896. Also, it is nice to see the unnecessary `nFeeRateNeeded` variable being removed. Would be good to mention this is a pure refactoring that doesn't change behavior in the commit description (same for the following 2 commits).::In commit ""wallet: Move long term feerate setting to CreateTransaction"" (d3191194a8ced53ae511551dce1321c0416d9e6d) In this commit and next commit, usage of SelectCoins is now more error prone because caller is responsible for setting `m_long_term_feerate` and `m_discard_feerate` variables in some cases (in other cases they are apparently never used), and there's not documentation about when to set them. Also these changes add to a proliferation of CoinSelectionParams constructor arguments can get easily confused together. A safer approach might be to make these `std::optional<CFeeRate>` members instead of `CFeeRate` members so the CoinSelectionParams constructor doesn't have to be involved with them at all. Then they can be directly set by name, and explicit errors will be triggered if they are ever accessed without being set. ::The constructor parameters are more to make the tests easier to implement.::Will update the commit message if I have to retouch.::Will update the commit message if I have to retouch.::I suggest not expanding the monster constructor here. Overall code readability seems to improve just assigning the new members after construction. (Also much cleaner to backport...)::See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21083#discussion_r579457178::re https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21083/files#r584415074 and https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21083#discussion_r579457178: I agree with @ryanofsky and @luke-jr that expanding this very large ctor signature makes the code less readable. Russ's suggestion of using std::optionals is good. Alternatively, I think these small changes would make things more readable: - add line breaks to the declaration and call sites, so there aren't 200+ column lines - add doxygen comments to the members so it's obvious what they're doing - use inline comments in the call sites: ```diff -CoinSelectionParams coin_selection_params(false, 0, 0, CFeeRate(0), CFeeRate(0), CFeeRate(0), 0, false); +CoinSelectionParams coin_selection_params(/* use_bnb= */ false, /* change_output_size= */ 0, +                                          /* change_spend_size= */ 0, /* effective_fee= */ CFeeRate(0), +                                          /* long_term_feerate= */ CFeeRate(0), /* discard_feerate= */ CFeeRate(0), +                                          /* tx_noinputs_size= */ 0, /* avoid_partial= */ false); ``` c++20 will bring [designated initializers](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization), which make initializing large structs like this much more readable. ::I've tried to make it more readable.

It's not a new policy, just what happens [in reality (when looking at bulk backports)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3ABackport+is%3Aclosed). However if this is controversial just drop the sentence. ::Sometimes it's possible to base a new commit on a commit *before* the branch split (e.g. between `0.19` and `master`). If nothing conflicts in between, it can be a clean merge to both branches (unclean merges are rejected by the CI checks). This is quite rare, though, and I'm not sure mentioning it here is important. If you're enough of a git guru to do this, you don't need it mentioned here.::@laanwj I see. @luke-jr Was this ^^ what you meant? I still think that one commit has to be the first one (in linear time) and merged into `master`.

My point was just if there is a better way to find ""parent"" (i.e. original upstream patch) but I found there is not because even in Linux kernel development (and I suppose they know how to use git given it was born there) they always write a comment in a backported patch: ``` commit <hash> upstream. ``` See [this backported patch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/commit/?id=9f8dd40c68c1) which is backport of [this original patch in master](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=3dd550a2d365) and the only difference between those two is the added comment: ```diff --- patchorig   2019-10-30 14:00:51.058777980 +0100 +++ backport    2019-10-30 14:00:30.865990235 +0100 @@ -1,9 +1,11 @@ -commit 3dd550a2d365 +commit 9f8dd40c68c1 Author: Alan Stern <stern@rowland.harvard.edu> Date:   Wed Sep 4 11:56:27 2019 -0400 USB: usbcore: Fix slab-out-of-bounds bug during device reset +    commit 3dd550a2d36596a1b0ee7955da3b611c031d3873 upstream. + The syzbot fuzzer provoked a slab-out-of-bounds error in the USB core: BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in memcmp+0xa6/0xb0 lib/string.c:904 ``` So maybe I totally misunderstood @luke-jr and was solving some non-issue here, but I learned a lot.
