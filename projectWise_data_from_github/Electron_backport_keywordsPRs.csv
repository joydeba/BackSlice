https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,28497,web-frame-clean-up::master,1,merged,semver/none::,"The previous implementation of webFrame in the renderer process leaked sub-frame contexts and global objects across the context boundaries thus making it possible for apps to either maliciously or accidentally violate the contextIsolation boundary. E.g. `electron.webFrame.top.context` leaked the `window` object from the other side of the isolated world by accident (not by API, purely by implementation issues) This re-implementation binds all methods in native code directly to content::RenderFrame instances instead of relying on JS to provide a ""window"" with every method request.  This is much more consistent with the rest of the Electron codebase and is substantially safer. Notes: no-notes::do we want to keep this in for backportability?::Removing this (the deprecation warning) makes the implementation easier.  Need to figure out how best to handle this in older branches you're right::```suggestion content::RenderFrame* frame = render_frame(); ```::```suggestion void OnDestruct() override { // The underlying RenderFrame can be destroyed while this class // still lives, so all calls to |render_frame()| must be null-checked. // The MaybeGetRenderFrame method handles this. } ```::```suggestion "" could be executed""; ```::slight preference for this to receive `v8::Isolate*` instead of `gin_helper::ErrorThrower`. The latter is a zero-cost wrapper around an isolate pointer and can be ""constructed"" for free.::Why does this method have a handle / context scope when none of the others do? It doesn't look like it's ever called from outside of V8. Also, is `context` still needed here?::What does this change do..?::```suggestion if (!MaybeGetRenderFrame(thrower, ""findFrameByName"", &render_frame)) ```::I don't know, this method was copy-pasted.  Happy to take a look at some point but I don't want to change actual implementations here.::This specifically, changes `GetFrameParent` to return a new `WebFrameRenderer` instance for the given RenderFrame instead of just returning that frames global object.::Ah, I see, we used to do that wrapping on the JS side. 👍 ::I am removing this in https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/28456::",ab3a328ce5f108a5980828e9ac5655ad4be77f90::97e16b31786192637add95ecfd484033af6bb8a6::2d13f0b5cdbd1456a349d6bd94e4f98c7d6a2f02::962816823268716a68efd125b0cd1594b2b9d612::28183c2172ffd5b7d1eb621ef6920d63c9ca844d::

However, if the imported sheet from best-sheet.com makes more nested fetches, those nested requests should use best-sheet.com as the basis for their referrers (as they do currently). This CL updates CSSParserContext's referrer setting logic to roughly do the following: - inline CSS: use the embedding document's URL as the referrer, or, for srcdoc iframes, walk up the frame tree until hitting a non-srcdoc frame - requests from fetched stylesheets: just as currently, use the fetched sheet's URL as the basis for constructing the referrer This seemed like it required refactoring CSSParserContext slightly because there are constructors that take both a Document and a base URL, and it's not obvious from the constructor signature whether the Document or the base URL should be the one that provides the referrer. To resolve this ambiguity, the refactor updates these CSSParserContext constructors to take caller-provided Referrer objects.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,27926,revert-webframemain-executejs-isolated::master,1,merged,merged/12-x-y::semver/patch::,"#### Description of Change Addresses #27862. The upcoming `WebFrameMain` API implements `executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld` with an interface that doesn't match that of `WebContents`. Because we need to reconcile these two APIs, this PR temporarily reverts the API before the Electron 12 stable release. We'll then restore the refactored API both in master and in a 12-x-y minor release. _Note: I targeted master and a 12-x-y backport to keep master and 12 in sync, but since this is being specifically reverted for 12, happy to change this and only target 12._ #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,27920,smooth-webcontents-shutdown::master,1,merged,semver/patch::,"#### Description of Change This PR cleans up the shutdown routine of WebContents, so: 1. The `content::WebContents` is always destroyed synchronously in the destructor of `api::WebContents`. 2. The only way to destroy `api::WebContents` is to call `api::WebContents::Destroy`, both in C++ and JavaScript. With this change, it becomes much clearer how WebContents is destroyed, and the WebContents will have a deterministic destruction order. Note that this PR might introduce new crashes, we should not backport it to old branches. #### Checklist - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes - [ ] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [ ] relevant documentation is changed or added - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: none::",93bcbb575d766496b8c2a34c036dd9d6d68a5a0d::

This change helps apps on 11-x-y running on mac arm64 to load wasm modules in node processes. Also given the Paritition-alloc everywhere move https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1121427 this should align with it too.

While not a very strong security boundary, making it possible for users to know what extension a file will be saved with is a good idea. This also fixes support for compound extensions with the File System Access API (i.e. "".tar.gz""). The mac file dialog already had a workaround if the default path ended in such an extension, but the same problem occurs if the file type filters include a type with a compound extension.

This collapses white space, limits the length of descriptions to 64 characters, and on windows strips out '*' characters to ensure the windows dialog itself will still include the true extension. This last behavior is triggered by the `keep_extension_visible` flag that was added in https://crrev.com/c/2582842 to fix a similar problem on Mac.

In ~MultiThreadedCertVerifier we loop through this list and reset the callbacks, but then delete the InternalRequest from the list. However, the callbacks are allowed to own the InternalRequest, so this leads to a UaF. We don't need to remove the InternalRequest from the list in ~MultiThreadedCertVerifier, because we are not in charge of the lifetime of the InternalRequest. InternalRequest can remove itself from the list during ~InternalRequest, or MultiThreadedCertVerifier can remove it from the list when a CertVerification job is complete. The former is safe because ~InternalRequest won't remove itself from the list if the MultiThreadedCertVerifier is already destructed. The latter is obviously safe because if the request was cancelled, then InternalRequest::OnJobCompleted will never run, so |this| is always valid to remove from the list during InternalRequest::OnJobCompleted. The added test reproduces the UAF without the fix.

To short-cut round trips to the X server when drag and drop happens between two Chromium windows, XDragContext stored the raw pointer to XDragDropClient of the source window in its source_client_ attribute. This made possible to access the deleted object (use after free) if the source window had been destroyed during the operation.  In short, although the target context can call the source client directly via the shortcut, the PropertyNotify event comes from the X server (not using the shortcut), and apparently it can come to the target context after the source window and its client had been destroyed but before the target context is notified.  See the issue for full details. Here the XDragContext::source_client_ is removed, and all its uses are replaced with getting the client from the global map of clients [1]. The client removes itself from the map upon destruction [2] so this change eliminates the vulnerability. For the record, there is the test in the interactive_ui_tests suite (namely BookmarkBarViewTest22.CloseSourceBrowserDuringDrag) that should emulate this situation but is has some flaws [3].

So I'm putting them in order in this PR. This will make certain backports harder, but I think it worths the efforts otherwise the class will only become more messy, and I already find it very difficult to add new methods to this class.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,27007,set-top-browser-view::master,0,merged,api-review/requested 🗳::backport/requested 🗳::merged/10-x-y::merged/11-x-y::merged/12-x-y::semver/minor::,"#### Description of Change This PR adds win.setTopBrowserView() so that browser views can be raised without removing them and re-adding them to the window. Raising browser views is necessary to control which view receives pointer events when there are overlapping views. Removing and re-adding a view also works, but has the problem of introducing a noticeable flicker. I'm unable to write a test for this because it does not appear possible to test which browser view receives pointer events. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply. For completed items, change [ ] to [x]. --> - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes - [ ] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [x] relevant documentation is changed or added - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: Added `win.setTopBrowserView()` so that BrowserViews can be raised.::We need to be careful here to ensure that the `BrowserView` which is being raised on a given `BrowserWindow` is not already attached to another window. If for example I call: ```js const win1 = new BrowserWindow() const win2 = new BrowserWindow() const view = new BrowserView() win1.addBrowserView(view) view.setBounds({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 }) win2.addBrowserView(view) ``` and then later call ```js win1.setTopBrowserView(view) ``` what behavior would a user reasonably expect to happen? Would this reparent the existing `BrowserView`? (Also see https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/27000 for related behavioral fix) I would say here that since `setTopBrowserView` makes the implicit assumption that the view _already_ exists on the parent window, that we should not be reparenting it in the event of the above - we should likely instead raise an exception or otherwise act in a way that least surprises the user.::Good call. I assumed it was safe because of how `addBrowserView()` was written. Seeing your change makes me think we should throw (rather than copying the fix).::",3a21895a3ba4a8affdd93164fa158598f8692086::0c580f20fd74655c4ef688802f27fc505753fb6b::a5b67de032b781d7cbe1740a3f3bdd83b5288832::5c61f6dbee34e0bc569e51185b2cbda023fd4c4c::8c50d31cb155bae6eed27d54edef708d766afa0e::3cb302b386c33f87119c1aad83574bef3f3d8e06::a86521d986a09150618b328d7d7a28f3d47a27bf::caf417d068a943051267035c9194b3b83287db5a::496cacfec14413d114abfcddf1f27f900d136c58::f70753b17e2b80fc7db27b3406287e4d9d24b7ce::00889c0b050ef21999d85a3b47d0168d3338a843::17766c730aea9efdf3e7dfd3591cc0466b749f9d::60a4aff84967b4a06bb8fc28cce0e6ab1cc257c1::

Also plans its removal for Electron 14. In order to remain backwards-compatible (in regards to promise support and exception handling) I moved the copy-value logic to use the ctx bridge to support non-clonable types and also updated the ctx bridge logic to better handle exception messages Notes: Changed the default value of `worldSafeExecuteJavaScript` to be `true`.::Will it work when this code is executed? https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/e641a747fb8bc5a7115e4b0581b756aca039b864/shell/browser/api/electron_api_web_contents_view.cc#L112-L113::Hm? Why wouldn't it, this isn't new code.  It's just a boolean flip::Can we add a link to more info about what `worldSafeExecuteJavaScript` does and how to change your code to compensate?::This looks new—is it fixing some behavior issue? Should it be separated out and backported to older versions?::Yes, my plan was to extract is separately as a backport but land together with this change.  Otherwise we end up with a chain of 3 or 4 PRs to land to land this 😆 ::The docs for `worldSafeExecuteJavaScript` explain ""values returned from `webFrame.executeJavaScript` will be sanitized to ensure JS values can't unsafely cross between worlds when using `contextIsolation`"".  I'm not sure how much detail we want here.::I think this document should contain enough information to: 1. Enable apps to check whether or not their app will be affected by the change, and 2. Give a brief outline of how to adapt to the change. For (1) we should mention greppable functions (e.g. `webFrame.executeJavaScript`, maybe also `executeJavaScriptInIsolatedWorld`?). For (2) we don't need to go into a lot of detail, maybe just ""ensure that objects returned from `executeJavaScript` are serializable""?::@MarshallOfSound related to #18369::you need to use `IsEnabled(options::kWorldSafeExecuteJavaScript, true);` as well::",bf7201d8f9210e575e4bb9c45fa901bd8717e8c1::01485e120457a3722248ac8c8afacbb5782767c2::d8dad4e7542520bea194b99cca72b3a499684443::7b1c81f136de7c03cd79804443cfdb82eecd8ada::

Since the new `webContents.setWindowOpenHandler` doesn't support BrowserViews, we can at least listen to the internal `-add-new-contents` event and create a BrowserView with provided `webContents`.

If a WeakPtr references an already-destroyed object, operator-> and operator* end up simply dereferencing nullptr. However, dereferencing nullptr is undefined behavior and can be optimized in surprising ways by compilers. To prevent this from happening, add a defence of last resort and CHECK that the WeakPtr is still valid.

Similarly, a `moved` event now emits on Windows when the window has finished being moved. ![2020-10-27_17-19-50](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1656324/97363240-a77c1080-1878-11eb-84a4-3aea300b613e.gif) I'm not quite sure whether it's possible to test this manual method of resizing the window. For now, I've added tests for macOS' animated resizing. resolves #24934 #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply. For completed items, change [ ] to [x]. --> - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [ ] `npm test` passes - [x] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [x] relevant documentation is changed or added - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: Added 'resized' (Windows/macOS) and 'moved' (Windows) events to BrowserWindow. ::I moved the Note into 'moved' since now the behavior only differs on this event. On Windows, 'moved' will only emit after the user has stopped moving the window. On macOS, it will always emit along with 'move'.::After moving the note, it reads to me like this: the `moved` event is not really implemented on macOS, it is just an alias of `move` event. But I think the actual behavior is reverse? The original note was confusing too, so I think maybe we should clearly describe the behavior in the note.::That's how I see it as well. You had left a comment mentioning needing to figure out a proper way to dispatch move. https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/d3f32c7502412ec143e25da41589ab923cf0b163/shell/browser/ui/cocoa/electron_ns_window_delegate.mm#L171-L177 For me, I assume `move` should follow similar behavior to how [`mousemove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousemove_event) works. It should be emitted at each change of the position of the window. `moved` should be emitted after moving is finished and should follow after the last `move` event. However, macOS doesn't have this behavior and will instead always emit after `move`. Does this make sense?::Yeah you are right. I thought `windowDidMove` would emit when moving is finished, but after testing I found it actually keeps emitting during the moving. So moving the note does make the doc more clear 👍 .::",67823273c0a68a7100c262e1c0f6ef35e4781466::

Is that desirable?::```suggestion it(`should set sec-fetch-mode to ${mode} if requested`, async () => { ```::```suggestion it(`should set sec-fetch-dest to ${dest} if requested`, async () => { ```::Should we perhaps only allow setting this through the headers?::We need to set the origin url but not the origin header for sometime.::I don’t think so. But I will add a test to ensure this.::It seems the network stack will remove the Sec-Fetch-User header if has_user_activation is false.::Done.::Done.::I added a test to make sure this doesn't happen.::This can be a single test: ```suggestion it('should not send sec-fetch-user header by default', async () => { const serverUrl = await respondOnce.toSingleURL((request, response) => { expect(request.headers).not.to.have.property('sec-fetch-user'); response.statusCode = 200; response.statusMessage = 'OK'; response.end(); }); const urlRequest = net.request({ url: serverUrl }); await collectStreamBody(await getResponse(urlRequest)); }); ```::Done.::Headers are case insensitive when read by the networking stack but this assumes that `origin` is lowercase here.  To be accurate this should somehow pull `origin` in a case insensitive way right?::The header names are stored in lowercase internally. This is another issue we may fix in the future. ``` setHeader (name: string, value: string) { ... const key = name.toLowerCase(); this._urlLoaderOptions.extraHeaders[key] = value; } ```::I just go ahead and fixed this issue too.::This tuple type is somewhat hard to read, I'd recommend instead using an object: ```suggestion const urlLoaderOptions: NodeJS.CreateURLLoaderOptions & { redirectPolicy: RedirectPolicy, headers: Record<string, {originalKey: string, value: string | string[]}> } = { ```::Fixed now.::",a440390dcd670f80441a0dafe9e61f9272d10857::c735095eb5e7404d6e7e7e7af4db1e55e7b307d6::5573c346f73d9b93654cf611cb404224a27c55d9::7b0ed5af4d5ef800189ca5fa715f09ef4cd7fcc3::b8da31e2f53da930d658f1f60f6e246ea9827a25::

Trying to get it into this branch so that the next stable version has that fix in `electron-apis.json` so that electron/algolia-indices#226 can land. Could further constrain the change to `yarn.lock` to not update the dependencies, but that was the result of updating it via `yarn`, and I think they're all safe and only used by the internal scripts. <!-- Thank you for your Pull Request.

This CL fixes an issue where autoscroll may be called on a scrollbar layer that is deleted. When the pointer is pressed down, an autoscroll task is scheduled to be executed after ~250ms.

So if you go from 2 to 1 scrollbar while an autoscroll task is queued, the autoscroll task won't get cancelled.

This adds a simple new method that aligns with what Chrome does to make killing a webConents in a hung state super easy. Notes: Added `webContents.forcefullyCrashRenderer()` to forcefully terminate a renderer process to assist with recovering a hung renderer.::This implementation is consistent with what's in hung_renderer_view.cc and smells OK in terms of working. I am wondering though what happens to these crash reports? If these get stored on the user's machine, does it make sense to have API that generates a lot of data files when working as intended?

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,25464,feat/web-frame-main::master,0,merged,api-review/approved ✅::backport/declined ❌::,"#### Description of Change While working on extension support in Electron and in other cases such as in writing tests (#17252), I've found a need to be able to access information about subframes within an instance of `WebContents`. The `webFrame` API is supported in the renderer process, but there's no equivalent in the main process. [Chromium's browser architecture](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/oop-iframes#TOC-Architecture-Overview) (since OOPIF) includes the concept of a ""render frame"" to represent a frame within the web content tree. This includes the `RenderFrame` and `RenderFrameHost` classes to represent a frame in the renderer and browser processes respectively. The `webFrame` API available to the renderer process seems to cover the case of accessing information about a `RenderFrame`. These proposed changes aim to expose access to `RenderFrameHost`s from the main process. I'd like to ask @electron/wg-api to please review early progress of this proposed API and let me know if it's something that the Electron team would be interested in. ----- Here's an overview of what I envision a finalized API could look like: ```ts /** An abstraction for a RenderFrameHost in the main process. */ interface WebFrameMain { processId: number; routingId: number; url: string; /** * This specific ID often comes into use from extensions. It corresponds to * the ID of the FrameTreeNode owned by a RenderFrameHost. **/ frameTreeNodeId: number; // Traversal properties top: WebFrameMain; parent: WebFrameMain; frames: WebFrameMain[]; /** Every frame in this frame's subtree, including itself. Useful for accessing the full tree as an array. */ framesInSubtree: WebFrameMain[]; // Methods executeJavaScript(code: string, useGesture: boolean): Promise<unknown>; reload(): boolean; } /** Global API for accessing WebFrames. */ interface WebFrameMainAPI { fromId(processId: number, routingId: number): WebFrameMain; } interface WebContents { /** Shortcut to get the top-level frame. */ mainFrame: WebFrameMain; } ``` With today's navigation events in Electron, this could offer a more complete API for interacting with frames: ```ts webContents.on('did-start-navigation', ( event: Electron.IpcMainEvent, url: string, isInPlace: boolean, isMainFrame: boolean, frameProcessId: number, frameRoutingId: number ) => { const frame = webFrameMain.fromId(frameProcessId, frameRoutingId); // ... }); // OR it could be used to clean up navigation APIs webContents.on('did-start-navigation', ( event: Electron.IpcMainEvent, url: string, isInPlace: boolean, frame: WebFrame ) => { const { processId, routingId } = frame; const isMainFrame = frame.top === frame; // ... }) ``` ----- TODO: - [x] Mark deleted `WebFrame` instances to prevent potential null pointer access of `RenderFrameHost`s. - [x] Implement remainder of proposed API. - [x] ~~Revise API to use similar interfaces to what's already offered by `webFrame`? I'm interested to hear what folks think about this.~~ - [x] Merge electron/typescript-definitions#175 to fix type definitions. ----- Related issues which this could help solve: #24791 - discovery of all frames of a domain #18371 - access cross-domain iframes (not limited to single renderer process) #14350 - access to all frames of webcontents resolves #17252 #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply. For completed items, change [ ] to [x]. --> - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes - [x] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [x] relevant documentation is changed or added - [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: Added `webFrameMain` API for accessing sub-frames of a `WebContents` instance from the main process. ::I'm a little sad to add a new top-level module just for this one function. Perhaps we could make this `webContents.frameFromId(...)`? or, to follow `BrowserWindow.fromId()`, make it a static method on the `WebFrameMain` class?::I think we can do better with this example :) Perhaps show an example of what you might do with the module?::Prefer a private method over a #define please. See e.g. `CheckAlive` in shell/browser/api/electron_api_tray.cc.::Perhaps refactor this lookup into a common function? The code is repeated in a few places and I think a `WebFrame* FromRenderFrameHost(content::RenderFrameHost* rfh)` function would aid readability.::nit: ```suggestion thrower.ThrowError(""WebFrame is available only after app ready""); ```::```suggestion v8::Isolate* isolate) { gin_helper::Promise<base::Value> promise(isolate); ```::These functions can all take `v8::Isolate*` instead of `gin::Arguments*`, which will cause them to correctly throw errors when they receive more arguments than expected.::I agree with your suggestion, however, this was copied from elsewhere in the codebase. The same message is used for the session and webframe APIs. If we change it here, I imagine that'd make it harder for folks to find the solution if they searched the error message. Or we could change it for all of them. Or maybe I'm overthinking it. 😅::I wanted to ask about this function's design. In other code we allow `userGesture` to be an optional parameter. Should we do the same here? If so, is there a good example for implementing optional parameter with these gin types? edit: now optional in f8a4fc9::I like the latter suggestion of adding something like `WebFrameMain.fromId()`. I noticed that APIs only seem to use this pattern when the class itself is constructable (with `new`). - `WebContents` doesn't have a constructor and it provides a top-level `webContents` API. - `Session` doesn't have a constructor and it provides a top-level `session` API. - `BrowserView` has a constructor and it provides static methods on the class. - `BrowserWindow` has a constructor and it provides static methods on the class. In this case, `WebFrameMain` doesn't have a constructor and it would provide static methods on the class. This seems unique, but if we're okay with it, I'll move forward with this design. edit: I noticed `session` is another case of a top-level module with only one static method.::I blame the `webContents` docs 😂 I'll update once we decide on a path forward for static methods.::hm, you're right. Let's be consistent, then.::Yeah... this error isn't consistent in our codebase (there are already a few variations). The one I picked here is one of the more grammatically fluent variations. I'm not sure I understand your point about searching the error message, it should be just as searchable as it remains unique.::If the error message remains similar to others, finding it in search engines might be easier. Since you mentioned we use the grammatically improved version elsewhere, I'll switch to that. 👍 ::Added usage examples in cf87997::can we avoid using private APIs from `//content`?::Currently this is required for executing JS with a user gesture. https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/cf87997176986deee6c6b64d242e2ccc7871fce7/shell/browser/api/electron_api_web_frame_main.cc#L94-L99 The public methods available on a `RenderFrameHost` lack the ability to execute JS with both a callback and a user gesture. For reference, these are the two methods to choose from: ```cpp // This runs the JavaScript, but without restrictions.

Allows file access for extensions via an opt-in on per-extension basis. Pre-9 this was essentially ""enabled"" by default, until 9.0.0 broke react devtools on local `file://` urls (#24011). * API / doc is done. * Implementation works but is WiP (see below) * I don't like how flags are being passed this way, also a FIXME in `LoadExtensionForReload()` -- not sure yet when that is triggered. Probably replacing that with an additional method that sets the flags for a certain extension id and is stored in-memory would be a better approach. Fixes: #24011. Confirmed that react-devtools now works over `file://` if `allowFileAccess: true` is passed and doesn't work otherwise. cc @nornagon @samuelmaddock @RangerMauve Thoughts?

Looking at [Chrome's installed extension loader](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/extensions/installed_loader.cc;l=687;drc=02fc05043bd38d318ba9ce59ccc4c7602284f990), they use this to store global and extension-specific preferences at runtime—including [methods for getting/setting file access.](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:extensions/browser/extension_prefs.h;l=517;drc=3c2bf33cc5112e89df2ebc668def33b9363f1723) In `Session::LoadExtension`, we could call `ExtensionPrefs::SetAllowFileAccess` with the value of the `allowFileAccess` option. Then `ElectronExtensionLoader` can derive the `load_flags` from `ExtensionPrefs`. Chrome's [`InstalledLoader::GetCreationFlags`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/extensions/installed_loader.cc;l=687;drc=02fc05043bd38d318ba9ce59ccc4c7602284f990) is a good example of how this could work.::Done, thanks!::@samuelmaddock thanks for the feedback! I thought about that, but the thing I noticed while testing (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/24011#issuecomment-674315764) is that: 1) This preference doesn't appear to do anything on it's own, or it could do something I don't know yet. 2) In Chromium, this is apparently not what is used. * A call to `ExtensionPrefs::SetAllowFileAccess` writes to `{profile}/Preferences`. * But in Chromium that doesn't happen when file access is enabled in extension preferences. * Instead, Chromium stores that in`{profile}/Current Session` which is inexistent in Electron. My concern here is that as Chromium apparently doesn't use it in that scenario, perhaps `ExtensionPrefs::SetAllowFileAccess` does something _else_ and can have some other side effect? Or is that not the case? I can surely port to that if it would be safe to use it here.::```suggestion // allowFileAccess is required to load the devtools extension on file:// URLs. { allowFileAccess: true } ```::This also allows injecting content scripts into `file:` urls, yes?::This whole function should probably be `NOTREACHED()` since we never end up invoking it.::After looking more into this, Chrome implements a private API on the chrome://extensions page with a function `chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration(config, callback)`. [It's internal implementation](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/extensions/api/developer_private/developer_private_api.cc;l=891;drc=f8990f540193a784158e5e4d9ec3ac6d1cd76771) calls a utility which in turn calls `ExtensionPrefs::SetAllowFileAccess`. After this function is called, the value will stay in memory and (I think) persist to disk soon after. An extension loader implements a [`GetCreationFlags`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:chrome/browser/extensions/installed_loader.cc;l=687;drc=02fc05043bd38d318ba9ce59ccc4c7602284f990) method to then derive flags from `ExtensionPrefs`. In my opinion, sticking with this pattern close to Chrome will allow us to more naturally build on the extension support in Electron later on. As for the the location of prefs (`{profile}/Preferences`), I'm not sure what the right path would be for us. I think we can go with the default and change it later if needed.::I don't believe Electron persists such preferences to disk. Additionally, I'd prefer that the extensions loading stuff doesn't persist anything to disk internally, as that's often surprising for developers (e.g. ""i removed the `loadExtension(...)` line from my app, why is the react devtools extension still loading??"" behavior that used to be present.)::I looked more into this and it does end up getting called if an extension invokes `chrome.runtime.reload()`. A callchain starts from `ElectronRuntimeAPIDelegate::ReloadExtension`, to `ExtensionRegistrar::ReloadExtension`, and finally calls `LoadExtensionForReload`.::Update on `ExtensionPrefs`, they're mostly used by Chrome to persist extension settings for a profile. - Whether an extension has file access or can run in incognito mode. - The extension installation time. - If an extension is disabled, the reason why. - And many other Chrome-specific settings. These aren't too relevant to an Electron app and could be managed outside of Electron internal code. However, special cases such as [`chrome.runtime.reload()`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/runtime#method-reload) will cause this setting to be dropped without relying on storage such as `ExtensionPrefs`. Additionally, `ExtensionPrefs` _do_ end up persisting to disk using the same `JsonPrefStore` as `UserPrefs` which are setup in [`ElectronBrowserContext::InitPrefs`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/shell/browser/electron_browser_context.cc#L169-L185). To avoid this behavior, I believe it will be necessary to create an [`InMemoryPrefStore`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/prefs/in_memory_pref_store.h) exclusively for ExtensionPrefs which would be returned from `ElectronExtensionsBrowserClient::GetPrefServiceForContext`. Possibly a command-line flag could be used if a developer wanted to opt-in to persisting these settings?::@ChALkeR to followup, we can simplify this by avoiding `ExtensionPrefs` altogether. Adding a map of `extensionId -> allowFileAccess` could be added to `ElectronExtensionLoader`. When an extension is unloaded, we can clear it. That way we can allow persisting file access if an extension is reloaded.::```suggestion // TODO(nornagon): we should save whether file access was granted // when loading this extension and retain it here.

It doesn't implement all of the `chrome.management` functionalities, as they need to emit relevant events in `session` or in `session.extensions`, so that developers could set their own behavior. I will probably do that in another PR. Could this be backported to 9-x-y? #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,25060,renderer-spellcheck::master,0,merged,api-review/approved ✅::backport/requested 🗳::,"#### Description of Change <!-- Thank you for your Pull Request. Please provide a description above and review the requirements below. Contributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md --> Exposes renderer side browser spellcheck API to the javascript environment. Resolves https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/22829 Rationale: Electron-based apps that uses CodeMirror (a hugely popular editor) are unable to benefit from the built-in spellchecker since CodeMirror does not use a ContentEditable (everything is faked). CodeMirror exposes a way to highlight errors, but given that we are currently unable to ask for a spellcheck from javascript, all Electron+CodeMirror apps use a js-based spellcheck library like https://github.com/cfinke/Typo.js which is considerably slower than the built-in native spellchecker. This PR adds the following API: - `isWordMisspelled(word: string): boolean` - `getWordSuggestions(word: string): string[]` **Current WIP adds the methods to the global `process` object which is just so I can test that it works.** I've tested this and it works. Now to figure out where to put the API. Ideally I would like this to be a module on `require('electron')`, similar to [IPCRenderer](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/shell/renderer/api/electron_api_ipc_renderer.cc). In practice, I have not found a way to pass the `WeakPtr<Spellcheck>` to [the renderer API stack](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/renderer/api/module-list.ts). I was also unable to find a reference back to `ElectronRendererClient`/`RenderClientBase` from an API module. If someone with experience can give me some tips on how to achieve it that would be great! Also currently missing tests and documentation. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

My guess is it should probably be on something like `webFrame` 🤔 ::Yeah agreed. I'm debating whether to put it on `webFrame` or adding its own module, something like `require('electron').spellcheck`. Here's what I wrote in the PR description: > In practice, I have not found a way to pass the `WeakPtr<Spellcheck>` to [the renderer API stack](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/lib/renderer/api/module-list.ts). I was also unable to find a reference back to `ElectronRendererClient`/`RenderClientBase` from an API module. > If someone with experience can give me some tips on how to achieve it that would be great!::@lishid You can find some examples on adding new modules under `shell/renderer/api/` folder. Adding the APIs to `webFrame` would be simplest and you only need to move the code to `shell/renderer/api/electron_api_web_frame.cc`.::@zcbenz Thank you for the help! In my working copy I was already able to move the code & API to `webFrame`, however, I was unable to find a reference to [the spellchecker object](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/shell/renderer/renderer_client_base.h#L84) which is located on RefererClientBase. Any tips? It seems that all the samples I've seen only references `content::RenderFrame` gotten from a [v8::Context](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/shell/renderer/api/electron_api_web_frame.cc#L93)::Since the `RendererClientBase` is guaranteed to have only one instance per process, I think you can add a `RendererClientBase::Get()` method to return the global instance, like what we do in `ElectronBrowserMainParts::Get`. Chromium also does a similar thing for `ChromeExtensionsRendererClient`, so this pattern should be fine.::Great having some code I can reference makes this a lot easier. Will update the PR soon, thanks again!::Can you move this to anonymous namespace? i.e. where the `GetRenderFrame` are defined.::Hang on, I think we can just specify `kNoTag` for the tag? Which would mean we wouldn't need to fetch the render frame, which makes me think maybe this API shouldn't be on `webFrame` at all?::hm... https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/spellcheck/renderer/spellcheck_provider.cc;l=310;drc=c83ae1d48c762639e626be9be0c77a209fdea359 is a reference that uses the routing id. there are other places in the code that use `kNoTag`. cc @MarshallOfSound for further review::It seems to be used in the macOS platform spellchecker impl: https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/spellcheck/browser/spellcheck_platform_mac.mm;l=201;drc=da08b7363d0947b0e7d98c5282b4cca513f62100::``` self_ = nullptr; ```::I could add this, but it didn't seem necessary given it wasn't added for ElectronBrowserMainParts https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/01dc50d8295690058fbde34b540e3b44b486bdbc/shell/browser/electron_browser_main_parts.cc#L205::",1aad1398df7d43a1a9903d9ca1cfbfb88235bc4b::

Breaking changes may not be merged to master until 11-x-y is branched. #### Release Notes Notes: Added app.createThumbnailFromPath() API that returns a preview image of a file given its file path and a maximum thumbnail size.::We should be using `QLThumbnailDispatchAsync` first here to ensure that we don't block the main thread while we wait for quicklook to generate the thumbnail.  This API will need to return a promise. Refs: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklook/1402621-qlthumbnailcopyimage?language=objc > If you call this function directly without using QLThumbnailDispatchAsync, this function blocks the calling thread until it finishes computing the thumbnail. ::The width and height are not possible to be less than 0, they are forced to be >= 0 in `gfx::Size`. The check can be simplified with: ```c++ if (size.IsEmpty()) promise.RejectWithErrorMessage(""size must not be empty""); ```::It should be fine to accept relative paths as with other path related APIs.::Should use `base::mac::FilePathToCFURL` instead, it is hard to tell whether lifetime management is correct with this code.::You can use the `size.ToCGSize()` helper.::Should use smart pointer to manage objects when possible: ```c++ base::ScopedCFTypeRef<CGImageRef> cg_thumbnail(...); ```::Should use smart pointer to manage objects when possible: ```c++ base::ScopedCFTypeRef< QLThumbnailRef > ql_thumbnail(...); ```::The lint warning should be gone if you place headers in this way: ``` #include <windows.h> #include <thumbcache.h> #include <string> #include <vector> ```::Should use smart pointer to manage the item: ```c++ Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<IShellItem> item; ```::Should use smart pointer to manage the item: ```c++ Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<IThumbnailCache> pThumbnailCache; ```::Should use smart pointer to manage the item: ```c++ Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ISharedBitmap> pThumbnail; ```::The `result` should be `autorelease`d or managed by a smart pointer otherwise it would be leaked.::Should use smart pointer to manage the icon: ```c++ base::win::ScopedHICON icon(CreateIconIndirect(&icon_info)); ```::nits: * Should document that `width` and `height` must be positive * Guessing without peeking: this sounds like we're saying that `maxSize.width` *will* be honored? If so, we shouldn't say Windows will ignore `maxSize` and instead say it will ignore `maxSize.height` * Similar to previous, ""...according to `width`"" would be marginally clearer as ""...according to `maxSize.width`""::We don't need 2-3 copies of the input sanitizing code. Better to have one function in electron-api-native-image.cc that does these checks, then delegates the work out to per-platform functions that take presanitized input.::This function is deprecated. Is it the best option?::These are the same test -- they could be merged into one test with something like ```js const badPath = process.platform === 'win32' ? '\\hey\\hi\\hello' : '/hey/hi/hello'; ```::This is removed in the latest commit, it was my mistake where I was unaware that gfx::Size does not allow negative inputs ::Do we need per-platform implementations of this? For example, what if we did something like this, in a non-blocking thread: ``` gfx::ImageSkia original; electron::util::PopulateImageSkiaRepsFromPath(&original, filename); auto scaled = gfx::ImageSkiaOperations::CreateResizedImage(original, skia::ImageOperations::RESIZE_GOOD, size); gfx::Image image(scaled); return Create(isolate, image); ``` To be clear, I haven't tested this pseudocode and don't know what the quality of the output is. The reason I think this would be worth trying is: * Better to maintain one codebase instead of two * And that one codebase is simpler and has no deprecated API calls * If it works, it would eliminate the ""width but not height supported on Windows"" wart * Picks up Linux for free::I believe the other option is QLTHumbnailImageCreate (https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quicklook/1402623-qlthumbnailimagecreate?language=objc) but @MarshallOfSound mentioned that we don't want to use that as it is a synchronous function:: ur totally right thanks! ::~~IsEmpty() is terser than the previous ""width <= 0 ... height <= 0"" checks but this revision lets negative sizes get by, e.g. `maxSize { width: -1, height: -1 }`. Changing that to `isEmpty()` isn't necessarily a blocker if you *intend* to let those values through, but since nothing's mentioned in the new docs, I thought I'd ask if you meant to let those through~~ nvm, I'm an idiot.::What this API does is create a *new* image from a path rather than resizing an old image we have different implementations because of the different APIs needed to extract a thumbnail from a path::I think the `NOLINT`s should no longer be needed here.::To be clear this constructs a thumbnail / preview / image _representation_ of a file at a given path.  i.e. we aren't resizing an image.  This means you call this API with a path to a word document and the OS will send you back a thumbnail image for that word document.::Can you move this to `rpc-server.ts`::",503b88e694dd2eb2175da606afebacba768e79f5::fbb5b0da562f9e87e3f4af713ee3a631e786285a::9daac1e605370db6cb61285a7b1e1dbdcb9c435a::a2a2c5e5fcef7fabeb9a9396b2d8680cab803c56::929b7ac6e7da51c272982dc7ccf4376809ae54f2::0907e0c485eeb878511945dcc06200881920fa62::991363a7a30c4b5ae5e37985cf8ddd54f144e802::7ba06edff441b41872af7939f26988f6302ad5cb::bbedfb248df2334c4f2ec32d2eef713c679b5050::010077b6da5bd4092599c5ab01d03ce371039693::a7ba57685575aee9c47083d8f02cb5c0426c77c4::361f68365c2b2d88bba4fa0e50cdee11cdc13c38::5dd4de5fb813ab8286304aacec605d50e51622d4::938f64a9591ea48ea859f2c2d18dc7321bfedb7b::4a4a4925ff0c869aa1119344116f7966fb7bfeec::63e2da2bd17e7ab15bdd114aca4358569c49aa9a::c012bfd0c1e2efc51e225a21b0b514ae7bc3c31f::7bfdf9900a412967297f3abd9c4355eaa97465ef::fc03f9bf4029fbe5c7670e99b476584df0a637f1::12c9022d27eaf65b1ab7af270e60049fc07a44c9::ab5df650ea9a5b49c87c079409d17c5d6c016bc4::e00eae486ac37ab59c76eae745b2dac9de7ba6d1::0aa2464ca4c8b495743b3b340fa0b370169844ce::7c7432775a0e00fd0b1c9a48de529acb4526932f::b0d1cefbebceb5f055ec3d26becd3bf424bcd893::

This does not need to go to 8 or 10, only 9, since it's been handled in the backports already (https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/24235). cc @MarshallOfSound #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Reason for revert: The original change makes an invalid assumptions about the lifetime of FidoDiscoveryFactory (crbug/1087158). Instances of FidoDiscoveryFactory generally belong to the AuthenticatorRequestClientDelegate and as such should outlive the WebAuthn request. As an exception, instances obtained via AuthenticatorEnvironmentImpl::GetDiscoveryFactoryOverride() may be unregistered and freed before the request finishes. This revert is safe because the caBLE data reset by ResetRequestState (a) only gets set in the first place if the WebAuthenticationPhoneSupport flag is on (which is default-off); and (b) gets set anew for every single request, so it will never be reused across requests. Bug: 1087158 Original change's description: > fido: add FidoDiscoveryFactory::ResetRequestState() > > FidoDiscoveryFactory instances generally outlive a WebAuthn request, but > some of the state is specific to a single request (caBLE pairing and QR > code generation keys). This is currently not an issue, because > AuthenticatorCommon explicitly resets all that state at the beginning of > the request. But I worry that we accidentally break that and leak state > between requests. To mitigate, introduce an explicit ResetRequestState > function and call it in AuthenticatorCommon::Cleanup(). > > Change-Id: I8333a3b14d189d7977cde17cbfe44b4b8dcf6ee2 > Reviewed-on: > https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1793792 > Commit-Queue: Martin Kreichgauer <martinkr@chromium.org> > Reviewed-by: Nina Satragno <nsatragno@chromium.org> > Reviewed-by: Adam Langley <agl@chromium.org> > Cr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#696593} Change-Id: I3b1ea46b9b1d5912cbc7ab9a82851e5132335ea8 Reviewed-on: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2228136 Reviewed-by: Nina Satragno <nsatragno@chromium.org> Reviewed-by: Adam Langley <agl@chromium.org> Commit-Queue: Martin Kreichgauer <martinkr@google.com> Cr-Commit-Position: refs/heads/master@{#774784} Notes: Backported the fix to a crash in FIDO support.::",a4eea41eebe3593eae31c7aaad525c09782795e4::c9cc826f1c1081a9eef0e57ad9252702f08580b5::6f216cd64a3c4d9bed5365e20d9694fa0c6cac5e::

However the new DBUS implementation is not production ready and has a decent number of bugs that would prevent folks shipping to prod. * #23448 * #22443 * #23287 This PR carefully restores the original code that Chromium deleted.  Tested so far on Ubuntu and will be testing on other distros shortly 😄 **Note:** I know this looks like a lot of code, but 99% of it is literally just copy-pasting code from Chromium that we had already shipped with for years. The intention is to remove this implementation was the DBUS implementation has achieved production ready-ness which I will be actively monitoring.  In a follow up PR (as this PR is supposed to be backported) I'll add a build flag to toggle between the implementations. #### Release Notes Notes: Restored old implementation of Linux Tray icons to fix a collection of issues where the tray icon wouldn't appear, would be the wrong size or would randomly disappear ::",dda720b337a85508504c5587fbaa7ba760ab34d6::

Before this patch, an unowned function pointer would be invoked asynchronously with a reference to the possibly freed reference to the browser context, which could cause use after free in certain circumstances. This patch makes the browser context own the callback and binds the function with a weak pointer, so freeing the browser context invalidates the weak pointer, which cancels the callback execution. After this patch, freeing the browser context aborts the asynchronous callback that dereferences the browser context, so the use after free is prevented.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,23247,langs::master,0,merged,merged/8-x-y::merged/9-x-y::,"#### Description of Change This PR aims to fix https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18829. Please refer to the issue for more details. Add implementations to set user's OS language preferences to `Accept-Language` and `navigator.languages`, on Windows and macOS. This also improves the CJK fallback font selection on Windows. Chromium uses `Accept-Language` to determine fallback fonts on Windows, especially kanji/han characters in CJK. Previously the full preferences set to OS was not given to Chromium.  For instance, when user sets `en-US, ja-JP` to `Accept-Language`, while Chromium chooses Japanese font for kanji text, but Electron chooses Chinese font.  This is because only the first language is given to `Accept-Language` on Electron. This patch is based on the idea given at https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/15532 /cc @nitsakh ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29440/80160961-eef3bc80-8609-11ea-9551-ef4b42909242.png) #### Considerations ##### fix or feat? ❓ No sure this a feat or a fix. Might be a fix, and backports would be appreciated as I'm thinking this is a bug for CJK speakers. ##### WinRT API <s>In this implementation, [`GetThreadPreferedUILanguages`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getthreadpreferreduilanguages) API is used on Windows. But, I noticed this API doesn't provide the full list of user preferences. Only the system locale (i.e. used for logon screen) and the user locale (i.e. UI used while logged in) are returned. So, how do you think about adding `ELECTRON_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE` environment variable to give the preferences correctly, in addition to this change? </s> ✅ Resolved using WinRT utility in Chromium https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/23247#issuecomment-618269313 #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

This also improved fallback font selection for CJK texts on Windows.::Can you move the language preferences code into separate files and then reference it here? Like this: ```c++ #include ""shell/common/lang_util.h"" prefs->accept_languages = GetSystemLanguage(); ``` It would make the code easier to maintain, and we might want to reuse the code in other places.::I wasn't sure where to put this kind of code. Extracted: d947ed9e7db679576d92045b7bdfe8254b37f645::would there be issue with fallback if there was a duplicate in the final string ?::Curious if we can remove this check incase its not necessary.::confirmed `navigator.languages`, and `Accept-Language` header would contain duplicated entry; this should have no issue but look strange from end-users maybe?::Cool, thanks for checking.

See that PR for more details. #### Description of Change Change the X11 version of `NativeWindowViews::SetIcon()` in `shell/browser/native_window_views.cc` to pass the user-provided icon to `SetWindowIcons()` once instead of twice. On X11, [`SetWindowIcons()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:ui/platform_window/x11/x11_window.cc;l=432?q=SetWindowIcons&sq=&ss=chromium&originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F) is implemented with [`XWindow::setXWindowIcons()`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:ui/base/x/x11_window.cc;l=780?q=XWindow::SetXWindowIcons&sq=&ss=chromium&originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F), which serializes both icons and sets the X11 property ` _NET_WM_ICON` with that serialized data. [`_NET_WM_ICON`](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/1.3/ar01s05.html#idm46041655311616) is just an array of icons, so including the same icon twice has no benefit. It also doubles the serialization time and keeps an extra icon in memory. This change sends an empty ImageSkia as the second icon, which is skipped by [`SetXWindowIcons`](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:ui/base/x/x11_window.cc;l=795?q=XWindow::SetXWindowIcons&ss=chromium&originalUrl=https:%2F%2Fcs.chromium.org%2F) No particular stakeholder; reviews welcomed from anyone :slightly_smiling_face: #### Checklist - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes - [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: Made setting window icons slightly faster on Linux.::",fdffaaaf4714ee90c282a6d4b58642128eac312a::

Not least, it would result in double-`std::move`ing of `navigation_id`.::Well, I was thinking of keeping support for both Electron's `webRequest` and `chrome.webRequest`. Is that possible?::I don't know, but the code as it is does not do that correctly :)::I assume that this would be tricky, so what I propose for now is that registering any `chrome.webRequest` would override the Electron's `webRequest` module. But I think that's not the behavior we want?::Hm, the Electron's `webRequest` could have priority over `chrome.webRequest`, so when a request is being intercepted by `webRequest`, the `chrome.webRequest` would not trigger. What do you think of that solution?::```suggestion if (use_proxy_for_web_request) return true; ```::```suggestion if (web_request_api) return web_request->HasListener() || web_request_api->MayHaveProxies() || web_request->HasListener(); ``` ? It's possible that the `WebRequestAPI` is available but doesn't have a listener, but electron's `api::WebRequest` does have a listener.::oh nevermind i'm blind::I think this needs the same treatment as `WillCreateURLLoaderFactory`? i.e. we need to check the return value here and early-exit if `extensions::WebRequestAPI` decided to take over the request.::Headers must be behind `#if BUILDFLAG(ENABLE_ELECTRON_EXTENSIONS)`::Is it good now?::yup thanks!::Is there actually a better way to get the `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` error? `fetch` throws only a `TypeError` with `Failed to fetch` message.::This behavior is different to `WillInterceptWebSocket`. Why? Can this be changed to gracefully handle the situation where `web_request_api` is null? Though I'm not sure in what situation that would be the case, these methods should at least be consistent with each other, either both DCHECKing or both gracefully handling nullptr. If there's a good reason for this to be different here, add a comment about why.::```suggestion return contents.executeJavaScript(`fetch(${JSON.stringify(url)})`); ``` is a little more robust.::```suggestion it('does not cancel http requests when no extension loaded', async () => { ```::All `expect`ations should be at the top level, otherwise the test runner will not continue running tests after a failure. ```suggestion w.loadURL(url); await emittedOnce(w.webContents, 'dom-ready') await customSession.loadExtension(path.join(fixtures, 'extensions', 'chrome-webRequest')); await expect(fetch(w.webContents, url)).to.eventually.be.rejectedWith(TypeError); ```::```suggestion w.loadURL(url); await emittedOnce(w.webContents, 'dom-ready'); await expect(fetch(w.webContents, url)).to.have.property('status', 200); ```::etc::Should this test that it only takes precedence on urls that the extension specifically intercepts? e.g. if an extension registers webRequest handlers for `*.google.com`, and the main process registers handlers through the Electron API for `*.slack.com`, both handlers should work.::If I recall correctly, I saw that DCHECK in Chromium code, but sure, I can handle this gracefully.::Is that okay? https://github.com/sentialx/electron/blob/a1cdc70435d953e0ad45fb8316b08dabbadc053d/spec-main/extensions-spec.ts#L232-L242::I'm a little confused how that test works. How does the `onBeforeRequest` handler get invoked given that it's supposed to only trigger on google.com urls, which aren't ever requested afaict?::Ah yes, I forgot, sorry.::Why is this entire file listed as having changed...? it looks the same 😕 ::This is redundant with the check that's at the top of the function.::I think this should be refactored to something like: ```cpp bool has_listener = web_request->HasListener(); #if BUILDFLAG(ENABLE_ELECTRON_EXTENSIONS) // ... if (web_request_api) has_listener ||= web_request_api->MayHaveProxies(); #endif return has_listener; ```::This condition will never be true because the previous line dereferences `frame`, so if it were 0, a segfault would have been thrown.::@nornagon if you look at the rich view diff, it only shows the new `chrome.webRequest` entry.  I'm wondering if the text view diff is a GitHub hiccup.::Is this relevant to us? Perhaps we should just `DCHECK` here?::What is this needed for?::What does this allow?::Can we change these to `https://does.not.exist` or `https://127.127.127.127` some other obviously nonsense URL? Our tests should never make external requests.::@nornagon There was somewhere a DCHECK in web_request_api.cc code requiring this.::@nornagon Returning `true` basically blocks all URLs to be processed through code in `web_request_api.cc`.

I can think of a few ways around this: - Manually write the `install_time` property to avoid the DCHECK - Patch //extensions to remove the DCHECK - Switch to using the `InMemoryPrefStore` to avoid any of this from getting written to disk I'll have to think on this more to see if there are other alternatives.::This is still persisted to the `Preferences` JSON store, but I modified the code to write only the `install_time` pref in 8d837e4 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1656324/94655327-653ccf00-02cc-11eb-9a1a-7fb140bb04b2.png)::I think this needs to be updated ```suggestion > **NOTE:** Electron's [`webRequest`](web-request.md) module takes precedence over `chrome.webRequest` if there are conflicting handlers. ```::`SetWithoutPathExpansion` is deprecated, see https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:base/values.h;l=661;drc=2a06d6e94a216850e057c4ba7d36c64032448c77 ```suggestion preference->SetStringKey(""install_time"", base::NumberToString(install_time.ToInternalValue())); ```::",792f228dfb17b05659a21b49f856fd217279e702::6d1a43fe12de245cf8f955a9b820ef5bf8bbfb90::3f679696603bfdfd0676c982d22b906e9f840c01::5647f6f3dbf1ede7a75b8ab66923fe02a586eb79::3dac5bc613acf8214120e0d833f6c5f63442454c::a77fb19606c4a4cb8f6502b8f58312fbabf93285::9d3cbd142e0a302bd3dff0e26ae52be2764dacd4::1b8a740b77bddc1e0634414e4ad8b3239d8af97d::3c06852e620d2215f8f36f4bcd23551497ed624f::89e3517cb10a8acca32e7da0dfcbd9833dc8c76f::a73ab76ae7a8cb6ededa2b01c5e6e8d720d7ddd8::7a5a9fc7f28868ad2774fda0362437b378a938fc::bb847acb3d21007955aa2779ffe331a47f054030::351af18852e61ba6ac77b388ee3ddef4ad28dcbf::9e9075c086887ceebce89a00f5c25828c0219ab6::8bb79bb4756172fb1bff8436608f33e10fb0fe03::d3da8eb968e6af15dde25cd64636d73bf68c2d3e::44718cc44ff9ca7742d367b88e28c4bbd6bb088e::cbe08d1c174ce05fdc32d3318e02d89fb1bdda20::95a8005a4a2204e5cef2dbcd16af39785cf86be1::f2cfafcb88a396a87aecf0c238ea857f374a80de::b47ff30d0b4daa5a1d7f70a9734a667be4bcc238::138a94dfa3b7f2bebf7009caba1baec398900f9a::3e3c8e87cd6789284f006946fac95efe605df27b::29234147de0d3f0407251240cd370b1d8523bfe4::50829fb1019413ab8f49741659e70d059b11bcd3::e7eb2a929fbb4d27e81fa2c7e4865b3cde64d799::9b9a60bac757d4efb21fc62c7eafc008e92c104b::f0c155825c49271fb281ee3d62c66bb6ef7e5736::d37ff74133cf8211b7c7b51f1ef97f1b105a0245::a1cdc70435d953e0ad45fb8316b08dabbadc053d::a6ded49c8f336dc2cb294ac525f1714564386105::5bb508ab539fb917dec2b15deae51dd53862a3ab::03ee78d021bcc87b7b9ce4af2138bc2fd7f8a575::38906dd5e035c718e82686e945a0bd2817120776::7912b3296583ab3e704d527220274e760aaa84fd::d7f4bbb2a060f581896b84dc5f61c3f597757243::1530eb25e4484b22c3ae9e2d1476b2a5c5e3efef::540ef6e55e5ba8c165eb8905eb27a50bc0a2e24f::39eb683c0f10e0fb8b6342e256042a04dff2e9ca::06583a02c3775aee845fc7640c7b57f40f0cf6b1::e00d117a579422cb81662d5606b2c4c68a3e2f79::b8b30eeebf9dcff96480ac5dba3b6ea13ec2099b::6967b36dadb31b58f83b89a31a00812e136ad1e2::df959931ed1fef6f6dfbe5247d6f72620aaf501a::39894b3c77227dc727a8fdb445e1f9632ccc1b55::4efc3183988b838104588dc925a8ea731a35c4ae::b5d407f24ae423b13194db0cb0cf48c7cbd28a96::8d837e4b9fb91bd75dbdb91ed98171fb40996bfe::436235f0ffa9a1cc32ea96a1d5b96fdcdf481fb6::fbdb5caf2fc23e296d77200005eb805f07887ba9::56ced0f4a85b781940681b4aee059a11893c8091::73056ba924c65813995f14cce6ceaa39c73854ed::f22999037483cfffedc5c3d0dd3f3635870c685e::16a62fd4de319274ca85723bb30809d75c5c34fd::f063a27426008447d4be336518796c707d82d07d::

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,21236,wip-window-open::master,1,closed,semver/minor::wip ⚒::,"#### Description of Change Depends on #19703 Commits are atomic — The two ""easier review"" commits are meant to be ignored, as they're file moves. The `feat: add webContents.setWindowOpenOverride API` commit contains the actual changes. This is an implementation of the draft spec defined here: https://github.com/electron/governance/pull/208. A few minor things had to change based on ease of implementation: notably the override handler passed to `setWindowOpenOverride` will receive fewer arguments than initially anticipated. This is to avoid patching. I'm unsure of the process — should I go update that document? Is that going to be a source of truth? Read the draft spec for full rationale, but a quick summary: this adds an API, `webContents.setWindowOpenOverride`, which 1) addresses a fundamental flaw in our current implementation: the user can only cancel a window while it's initializating 2) improves the ergonomics of an API burgeoning in importance. Code is better than words. **The old way:** ```javascript // main.js mainWindow.webContents.on('new-window', (event, url, frameName, disposition, options, additionalFeatures) => { // to cancel: event.preventDefault() // or... // to customize: Object.assign(options, { frame: false }) event.newGuest = new BrowserWindow(options) }) // renderer.js window.open('about:blank') ``` **The new way:** ```javascript // main.js mainWindow.webContents.setWindowOpenOverride({ url, frameName }) => { // to cancel: return false // or... // to customize: return { frame: false } }) mainWindow.webContents.on('did-create-window', (win, { url, frameName, options: browserWindowOptions, disposition, additionalFeatures, referrer, postData }) => { myApp.subscribeToWindowEvents(win) }) // renderer.js window.open('about:blank') ``` **Alignment of code paths** Another major pillar of this PR is the continuation of the work that @brenca was doing in #19703, where he more closely aligned the `nativeWindowOpen` and `BrowserWindowProxy` code paths. Before his work, it was unclear if and why things were different between them. Now they are just about entirely the same. To that end, I moved the BrowserWindowProxy-specific pieces to their own file. **Code cleanup** Finally, the code was ripe for cleanup and relatively hard to understand without reading several entire files. I tried to break out logic into contained functions and document the things I'd learned while puzzling over how the code worked. I think the most important piece of that was understanding how the browser options are created — now the precedence is much more clear. **Deprecations** I'm proposing the following deprecations. I'm not really sure the best way to go about deprecations in behavior, so please advise. - `new-window` event - This event is problematic, as described in detail in the draft spec, and is no longer necessary. - `additionalFeatures` - AFAICT, this is an Electron creation. Its inclusion also forces our window.open implementation to go against the html spec, as it says bare keys should be interpreted to be value `true`. - Parent option inheritance - currently, most options are inheritable from the parent if the window.open doesn't specify otherwise. This can be annoying for consumers, as it forces them to find the inverse of parent-specified options when they create the new window and broadly doesn't align with the paradigm laid out in the rest of our API in creating windows. It's much easier for a developer to reuse BrowserWindowConstructorOptions if they want similarly styled windows than it is for a developer to find the inverse of the parent-specified options should they choose to diverge. Note that these are not removed in this PR as it's designed to be backportable. **Snapshots** Because this is rather heavy refactoring of the code underlying `new-window`, I employed snapshotting to prove to myself (and you, the reviewer) I hadn't broken things. I'm not wed to the idea that they actually are merged, but I do think they're generally useful. There are a couple small changes in the snapshot (which you can review in the commit `test: update new-window event snapshots` that I found to be permissible and in my mind represent ""bug fixes"" in the API. I recognize there is a blurred line between bug fix and API change so I want to call it out so we don't break applications in a minor bump. The most significant: previously, the `show` option was inherited from the `parent's visibility` (not their `show` property,  which could be different). I think this is incorrect behavior. If I open a window and don't specify show=false, it should be shown. However, I am willing to budge on the inclusion of this change in the backported version. <!-- Thank you for your Pull Request.

This patch includes three parts: 1. Manual backport of #21045 (plus a handful of similar issues found in `8-x-y` not present in `master`). See that PR for full description. (CC @codebytere, @jkleinsc) 2. Add `breakpad` as a target for our patches, since we now need to patch that in a couple of places. Unfortunately one of those patched files has dos-style crlf line endings, which prompts the third part: 3. In `electron/scripts`' import/export patches, add support for patching dos-style files whose lines end with crlf. Previously we were stripping line endings and appending `\n` to the end of each line, which caused `git am` to fail when patching dos files. It might be worthwhile to apply this portion to `master` as well even if we're not currently patching any crlf files there. (CC @nornagon, who patched a [similar problem](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/15579) last year, for second opinion) #### Checklist - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [ ] `npm test` passes - [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: no-notes::",6410d86b3683273b3eeb4ead803655d7f35bd8e8::40820544cbc0583d1628731428e7b862ca47a700::bdee5fd0d494cb31b5906b175976a3633ee1cbb1::45686396558af39be64e48ad0036e5017e204348::c6861ab5c17f10ff7ec710a7dbaec2a2bfbd3cf4::2cbc07ddc90ebb217edf7451431b69ad98b5bc27::c5774ee2a9a16f5a05f3149fa07d4a23d2a0adc8::6e4d54a9d04b1fc6714ecc76db8c8069cc172ea2::144ff263a758608616a8212fd050166b30721225::82e9b85e1d0ee6ead54a572bfafe688fc408f92f::a05a362b7b117b60313e2b24811fee5bb6c90bdc::1d7655c231033fc605bdec679f39b498cbe2886b::71996b61cddd7faa349b60bfef956721dc1ff0a2::

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,20965,mas-patch-remote-layer::master,1,merged,merged/8-x-y::merged/9-x-y::,"#### Description of Change Close https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/20027. This PR disables following private macOS APIs used in Chromium: * `CAContext` * `CALayerHost` Chromium has 2 ways of rendering on macOS: one is using official `IOSurface` way, and one is `CARemoteLayer` API. The `IOSurface` way is used when software compositing is enabled, and when the remote layer API is not available. This PR forces using `IOSurface ` even when remote layer API is available, it essentially behaves the same with passing the `--disable-remote-core-animation` command line flag. More information can be found at https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=312462. * `NSAccessibilityRemoteUIElement` All related code using this class are disabled. It would affect accessibility when remote layer API is used, but we should be fine since remote layer API is disabled too. * `NSNextStepFrame` * `NSThemeFrame` Chromium overrides these private classes to implement custom frame. All related code are disabled so custom frame would not work. Since in Electron we only support standard frame and simple frameless window, we are not affected. * `NSURLFileTypeMappings` Chromium uses it to guess mime type from extension names, the iOS version of Chromium does not use it.

Please provide a description above and review the requirements below. Contributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md --> If the receiver end of the `ElectronBrowser` mojo interface disconnects, we should signal the WaitableEvent to continue execution. We are hitting this in the very specific case of a `event.preventDefault()`-ed `nativeWindowOpen` child window with a preload script that sends a synchronous IPC. Because the nativeWindowOpen API is kinda janky, the WebContents is already created by the time we get the preventDefault from the consumer, so we do the only thing we can do: [destroy the WebContents](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/9bd63864e487532e0adb7d36473fb72d7f83c09a/atom/browser/api/atom_api_web_contents.cc#L578). But the preload script has already started running, interestingly, first _in the opener renderer_, because site isolation may not have forced the new window into its own process yet (if it turns out to need a new process, it seems that Chrome kills the context and starts again). This is what caused the freeze we saw: the preload for the child window was running in the parent and, once the WebContents was destroyed, responsible for responding to the synchronous IPC we'd sent, hung. This is targeting 6-0-x because the 7-0-x/master fix is slightly more complicated, given that we switched to a thread safe interface pointer which doesn't allow us to set an error handler. I'll patch in the error handler to the thread safe interface pointer in an upcoming PR. Then I'll upstream that patch, as Chrome has expressed openness to that addition. Longer term, ideally we would allow the user to opt-out of the window creation earlier, to avoid creating a WebContents at all. It's very strange that the preload starts running twice, once in the renderer and once in the new process (if applicable). Changing this should be taken on as part of a broader effort to improve the native window open API. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,20307,context-bridge::master,1,merged,semver/minor::,"#### What is this? This PR adds a new renderer-side module called `contextBridge` that allows you to expose an API synchronously from the isolated context to the main world (and optionally back again) to achieve the following goals. 1. Make it really easy for folks currently doing the `window.api = {}` pattern to enable contextIsolation.  The migration becomes `bindAPIInMainWorld('api', {})`. 2. Make it possible for synchronous APIs to exist between the main world and the isolated world.  Some app logic is heavily tied to being synchronous and rather than ask folks to refactor their entire app we can just make this possible. 3. Kind of tied to (1) this would solve the ""developer experience"" issues we briefly touched on at summit around enabling contextIsolation.  Once this is in, working and tested enabling `contextIsolation` by default no longer seems like a daunting task. #### How? The docs outline a lot of how this works from a users perspective so I'd recommend reading those.  From a Behind The Scenes perspective it is all implemented using our current converter and binding infrastructure. Primitives / Values get converted to `base::Value` and then converted back to `v8::Value` but in the other context.  Functions get stored as `v8::Global` and then proxied into a bound cpp method that calls the original function in context A.  Then does the primitive move trick and moves it to be the return value for context B.  Their is special logic to proxy promise return values but you can see that both in the docs and the source code. #### TODO: * [x] Freeze the API object that gets bound to ensure it is immutable in the other world * [x] Document that the API object is frozen and immutable * [x] Function arguments need to be proxied * [x] Only expose `debugGC` in a testing build * [x] Code clean up * [x] CI Tests that it works * [x] CI Tests that we don't leak prototypes across the bridge * [x] CI Tests that sending functions isn't a memory leak * [x] Naming? Main World vs Main Process -- How do we make that clear? * [x] Prevent recursion destroying us. * [x] Keep a weakmap of objects as we traverse, use already proxied versions if we can * [x] Throw an error if we handle a thing with a recursion depth >= 10000? * [x] Use the V8 serializer - Copy from @nornagon PR and resolve conflicts with whoever lands first Notes: Added new `contextBridge` module to make it easier to communicate between an isolated context and the main world::I think since contextIsolation is mentioned in a BW constructor option and isn't _super_ obvious from just a link to `browser-window.md` that it would be worthwhile to lower that barrier and re-copy it here or move it into a standalone document we could link to::It'd be helpful to add a brief explanation of what a world / context is, for example the JavaScript globals being different while the DOM remains the same.::You could also enforce a compatible api with something like: ```ts type Primitive = | string | boolean | number | bigint | symbol | null | undefined; type TransferableType = Primitive | Promise<Primitive> | Array<Primitive> | void; interface ProxyInterface { [k: string]: TransferableType | ((...args: Array<TransferableType>) => TransferableType) | ProxyInterface; }; ```::Will `undefined` / `null` work once we swap to the new serializer?::How bout Arrays containing promises 🤔 ::If `bind` already exists, I assume we'll just override it.  We may want to error / warn if that happens. > You can use this method by providing it a single `api` object in the same structure as the original `bindAPIInMainWorld` I'd use ""same limitations"" rather than ""same structure"" since structure could also be interpreted as ""the same keys and values""::Are there also more details that we need to mention around different frames?  Don't fully remember the distinctions::This limitation is gone now right::@samiskin Unfortunately due to technicaly reasons this type is not the one exposed to end users.  Typing this part strictly wouldn't be all that helpful. That type would be correct though if we can get it into the type generator::Yup 👍 ::Can you use `gin` APIs in this file? `mate::Dictionary` is replaced by `gin_helper::Dictionary` in `shell/common/gin_helper/dictionary.h`.

To avoid churn I chose to use `mate` in this file to ease the backport.  I'll refactor to `gin` once it's landed 👍 ::This is reasonable, I'm good with `mate` in this file then.::`v8::Global` resets itself automatically on destruction, so we do not need to do manual reset here.::Not a big issue but we can avoid duplicate lookup: ```c++ auto it = store_map_.find(render_frame); if (it == end()) ... return it->first; ```::The `util::Promise` can be allocated on heap, so `UnsafePromiseHandle` should not be needed: ```c++ auto* promise = new util::Promise<v8::Local<v8::Value>>(isolate); auto then_cb = base::BindOnce([](util::Promise* promise) { promise->Resolve(); delete promise; }, promise); ```::what about calling it just `bindInMainWorld`?::Updated to `exposeInMainWorld`::delete `default_app/index.ts`?::I'm not sure this is better than just hooking the `DOMContentLoaded` event::Add a short paragraph explaining why the reader might want to use this.

Perhaps we should use a different word for the world where the page scripts run?::Again, ""Main World"" vs. ""Main Process"" seems like it might be unnecessarily confusing. Is it too late to change the terminology we use for main world?::are `BigInt`, `Map`, `Set`, `ArrayBuffer`, etc. allowed?::Is there a particular reason to do this rather than exposing a proxy?::```suggestion An example of a complex API object is shown below. ```::Maybe also include an async function example here? ```suggestion myPromises: [Promise.resolve(), Promise.reject()], anAsyncFunction: async () => return 123, ```::I don't think `JSON.stringify` / `parse` will provide any performance benefit if you're using the v8 serialization algorithm. also, ```suggestion Electron will attempt to proxy any object, array or other structure you provide the `contextBridge` module.  This includes method parameters, method return types, etc.  This can be quite costly when sending large data blobs.  If you need more performance out of the bridge and you are sending data, no methods or dynamic content then we recommend you `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` the content across the bridge.  E.g. ```::```suggestion Your mileage may vary and before you start stringifying everything we recommend that you measure the speed of both to see which one works best for you. ```::is this always turned on/off at the process level? won't this be wrong when `allowRendererProcessReuse` is enabled?::this doesn't seem to be referred to anywhere else, can it be removed?::```suggestion return internal::IsTrue(GetHandle()->Has(context, v8_key)); ```::Why is it safe to cast to `Object` here? Can you make this function take a `Local<Object>` instead?::use `base::NoDestructor`::This doesn't recurse into `Array`?::This will overflow the stack and crash if the object is cyclic, or deep enough. Which I suppose is the fault of the app developer, but still seems undesirable...::Won't there still be references to the store from `FunctionLifeMonitor`s hanging around here..?

Does this leak?::Once https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/20214 lands, errors should be serializable through the V8 value serializer.::I'm not sure I understand this sentence (""deep functions get proxied or arrays of promises""...?)

Opinionated but IMO it's better to remove that chance of the Hidden Cost.::> I don't think JSON.stringify / parse will provide any performance benefit if you're using the v8 serialization algorithm. We only use the V8 serialization algorithm for root nodes of the tree.  Anything in the middle is traversed by Electron's logic and proxied through Electron.  I benchmarked it and it's ~20% slower than using V8 serialization for everything but it's required in order to properly proxy functions and promises and such.::I think @miniak is doing work to move these options from command line flags and into webprefs but until that lands all the code in Electron has the same issue.::I'm going to use it in tests 👍 ::> Or do the v8 objects get cleaned up before OnDestruct runs? This is the case (at least from my own testing).  The context is destroyed before the frame is destroyed::My understanding is that the context is destroyed before the frame is destroyed, when the context is destroyed all V8 objects are GC'ed so this callback that is bound to V8 will be GC'ed which will then release everything else.::Rephrased.

Technically it's the same origin but a different context::Added a test, double checked we need this.  ::Confusing -- Yes Not sure what the alternative is though, we already deviated naming with `browser`/`main` process.  I don't want to invent a new name for worlds as well::I mean to use it for the map itself. We use `base::LazyInstance` elsewhere, but Chromium recommends using `NoDestructor` over `LazyInstance`: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/base/no_destructor.h?q=base::nodes&sq=package:chromium&g=0&l=37::I think there are a couple of options. 1. Use a custom stack and a loop, instead of recursion. Then you have to run out of memory to crash the process, which JS can do anyway but which is a lot harder than running out of stack. 2. Detect stack overflow and throw a `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded` exception. The `ValueSerializer` class in V8 does something like this (look for calls to `isolate->StackOverflow()` or `STACK_CHECK`).::The reason for the errors not to flow across origins is because you can inadvertently leak information through an error, and information isn't supposed to flow across origins unintentionally. I think the same is true of errors from the isolated world, right? I'd hesitate to say that the preload content has the same origin as the page, given the code comes from somewhere else and is controlled by something else. (I think in Chrome the isolated context is treated as having a `chrome-extension://` origin..? Maybe?) I suppose it's not as much of a concern as cross-origin stuff, because the error was generated in the same process as the page, so if the page really wanted access to that information, [it could have it](https://spectreattack.com).::I'm not sure I understand this: > We only use the V8 serialization algorithm for root nodes of the tree. Anything in the middle is traversed by Electron's logic and proxied through Electron. Can you rephrase?::FWIW I left this running on a thing nested like a million times and it didn't crash.  Not sure how deep it has to go for it to actually overflow 🤔 ::> serialized twice I'm not sure I get what would be serialized twice unexpectedly here? I was imagining a read-only proxy layer, so that updates in the isolated world are reflected in the main world. But perhaps that's enough of an edge case that we should go with the simpler option for now :+1:::Not sure what you did but here's a fiddle which crashes the renderer: https://gist.github.com/57c3730ec8bd3f170ca0a17e2b8fbdd7. Crashes at around ~50000 nested arrays for me.::Discussed: We're going to stick with Main World::Discussed: We're going to stick with Main World::I don't think error santization is what we want, partly because of the whole ""they're kind of the same origin"" and also because of this: > But in the promise unhandled rejection case error existence is hidden when kSanitize is specified. I.e. promise rejections are not supposed to be transferred when error sanitization is used.  That isn't that helpful for a bridge like this. I think the current measure of stripping the stack trace and only transferring the message hides enough information for now.::I also don't think ""main world"" is Good. Is there record of your discussion so I might change my mind or argue further?::Will this only ever be preload -> ""main world""? This line (and the name contextBridge come to think of it) suggest that you can expose to arbitrary contexts, which, as far as I can tell, is not true.::nit: I think we can do better than `apiKey`, which is avoidably loaded. I'm having trouble envisioning when a consumer would want to expose multiple API objects on `window` in the main world. It seems more likely that they'll want to expose a single object under one key, almost every time. Would it make sense to include a reasonable default and make the API slightly simpler? Maybe a signature like: ```ts contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld( api: { [key: string]: ContextBridgeSerializeable }, name?: string = 'electron' ); ``` And your example becomes: ```ts contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld({ doThing: () => ipcRenderer.send('do-a-thing') }) ```::preload -> main world and main world -> preload (bi-directional) The code in theory could also bridge any worlds but currently it's only intended to support a bridge between these two.::I've got a few use cases in mind for exposing multiple things it helps in tests + actual apps might want to use it (including us 😄 ).  Not sure I want to standardize `window.electron`::why move this to the preload script if the code can run just fine in the web context?::I get that we want to use the new API, but that's only strictly necessary for getting the versions.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,20232,fix-popup-bounds-offset::master,1,merged,,"#### Description of Change * Fix a popup positioning regression that caused the embed offset to be lost. Looks like this regression is pretty new from #18760 and doesn't need any backport. :tada: * Silence a minor clang-tidy warning about implicit type narrowing from int to float. This isn't a big deal, but the changed code is also easier to read.

Please provide a description above and review the requirements below. Contributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md --> This is a revert of #8047, the issues mentioned there are not reproducible after the revert (in fact #7951 resurfaced, and this fixes that). Since the issue mentioned in the comments (#2498) is about frameless window sizing and the PR I created to improve that landed in `6-0-x`, I'm only backporting until that to make sure not to re-introduce the original bug. Fixes #13043. Fixes #16900. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

(Discussion: there are [slightly faster](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html#dictionaries) alternatives to `items()` on python2, but since we're only dealing with a few folders, they're overkill) * `Popen.communicate()` takes a byte array in python3, so when using it in `script/lib/git.py`, send `patch_data.encode('utf-8')` rather than `patch_data`). ([Discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48169667/how-to-handle-subprocess-popen-output-in-both-python-2-and-python-3)) * When reading patches from a directory, use `codec.open(filename, encoding='utf-8')` to ensure the previous line item's encoding will succeed.

According to our discussion in https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/19128#issuecomment-509439237, it would be best to revert the fix for now, especially since this regression has already been backported into 4.2.X, 5.0.X, and 6.0.X. For now, the test that I wrote in #18995 has also been commented out. cc @codebytere @zcbenz @nornagon #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

There is a bug with Chromium that, after setting window style, calling setFrame with animation immediately would block window rendering for a few seconds. This Chromium bug is fixed in later versions, but it is hard to find out how to backport the fix or how to work around it, disabling the animation is the easist fix and most users would not even notice it. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

The expected behavior is that the promise won't be resolved until the user grants or declines permission for media access on macOS.

The bug seems to be present in v6 and master as well, although Chromium says the [original issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=885184) is fixed.

This PR fixes the bug in `ipcMainUtils.handle` that, the helper waits on Promise returned by handler when it shouldn't. For the original issue, `ipcMainUtils.handle` waits on the Promised returned by `WebContents.loadURL`, resulting in setting src being blocked until the URL is loaded. #### Checklist - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes - [x] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) - [x] [PR release notes](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md) describe the change in a way relevant to app developers, and are [capitalized, punctuated, and past tense](https://github.com/electron/clerk/blob/master/README.md#examples). #### Release Notes Notes: Fix setting `src` on `<webview>` being too slow.::Shouldn't there be a corresponding doc change to note the loadURL is now async?::@jkleinsc The `<webview>.loadURL` was actually asynchronous while it was under put `syncMethods`, the `WebContents.loadURL` API works asynchronously that it only starts the loading and returns immediately without waiting for anything. So with this PR `<webview>.loadURL` won't change any documented behavior. The side effect of this PR is making `<webview>.loadURL` return a `Promise`, but since we are backporting it to 6.0, I think it is probably better keeping it undocumented otherwise it would be a `feat`.::@zcbenz I understand what you are saying, but what happens then is we do not end documenting this behaviour.  I would rather see the doc change made and go through @electron/wg-releases to approve moving this `feat` to 6.0.  Given the issue it solves I don't think it will be a problem to get @electron/wg-releases approval.::",c56b5b6d3c045f67daaf9194033cf15e6987530d::77dd7a8af97d1181b97bd60be17a7d354af06005::

Please provide a description above and review the requirements below. Contributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md --> 👋 This pull request uses the possible values for `role` in the `MenuItem` constructor to describe the instance `MenuItem.role`. This makes the types more consistent and allows developers to take the value of an existing `MenuItem.role` and use it to construct a new `MenuItem` without extra typecasting (or other workarounds). Helps with upgrading GitHub Desktop to Electron 5 (https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/7799), so it would be great to have this fix backported to 5 (and 6, I assume). :bowtie: Thank you! cc @codebytere #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,18756,intern/throw-error-invalid-cookie-url::5-0-x,1,merged,backport::semver/minor::,"#### Description of Change With this PR, invalid inputs to the `url` parameter will throw an error when using `cookie.set()`. This is done by checking if the URL is parseable using `GURL` rather than checking if the URL string being passed in is empty. Previously, invalid URLs would be able to be added as a cookie, but you would not be able to filter for them or remove them. See Electron Fiddle gist: https://gist.github.com/d8ae35040d44d426cb40d97d5d77a47e _N.B. This behavior was fixed in Electron 6, so we based this PR a lot on the changes in the cookies API from 5.0.3 to 6.0.0-beta._ This issue was discovered when playing around with the example from https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/18220. cc @DeerMichel @codebytere @ckerr #### Checklist - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes(https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [x] relevant documentation is changed or added - [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) #### Release Notes Notes: Added check for invalid URLs upon setting cookies ::prefer `is_valid` ``` From GURL::is_empty // Returns true if the URL is zero-length. Note that empty URLs are also // invalid, and is_valid() will return false for them. This is provided // because some users may want to treat the empty case differently. ```::```suggestion * `url` String - The url to associate the cookie with. The promise will be rejected if the url is invalid. ```::```suggestion if (!url.is_valid()) { ```::nit: @DeerMichel do you want to align the wording in the documentation that you put on #18751 with this one? I think confirming that it'll be a rejected promise might make the docs _slightly_ clearer 😅 ::sure::",ed42f6010384e00bb975f2a5225bc457bb79682d::ef325f6057f6ac5cbb2494097734387ac2c975df::1ce0f3d95a888c291d23a179798619ad246e56ce::c7239c74b8347671495cf2424c8796e494e53777::746cdc9acfe8d06d00c0e0f074f0b94858656571::8e45bff3ef73e91f98ced24317d956be382cbb4f::

Please provide a description above and review the requirements below. Contributors guide: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md --> Migrate crashReporter to use crashpad on Windows. This fixes issue #17993. Although chromium has moved to using crashpad for crash reporting on windows, electron was still using the deprecated breakpad. With this change, some crashreporter APIs that were only macOS specific will now also work for windows. Besides, the crashreporter process does not need to be started separately with the environment variable. Crashpad takes care of launching a process when the crashreporter is started from the main process. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

How come we need this and Chrome doesn't?::It's no longer `breakpad`, should we rename this function?::These options seem like they ought to be configurable::Will this break if the crashes dir has non-ASCII characters in it? (e.g. if the path contains `%APPDATA%`, which includes the user's home directory, which includes their user name, which may be non-ASCII) maybe ```suggestion base::UTF16ToUTF8(crashes_dir.value()).c_str())); ```::Would it be possible to transmit this info through a command-line argument rather than an IPC?::this means ""is main process"", right? maybe add a comment?::We shouldn't need to involve v8 in this... can `WebContents` maybe get a method that returns a direct pointer to the all the WebContentses rather than v8 handles?::This `args->erase(std::remove_if(...))` construction is confusing and I'm not sure it's doing what you intend. What are you trying to accomplish here? Perhaps there's another way to express this that's more clear?::is wrapping this with `base::FilePath` required / desirable now? What changed here?::This is somewhat concerning, what are the implications of the incorrect PID being returned here?::Chromium still uses breakpad for linux. So not until they move::Here's the related v8 change that added it. https://chromium.googlesource.com/v8/v8.git/+/969cb0c7a58b4c8b53ff411adde5fc4a5a6785e4::What part is confusing exactly? It's the standard erase-remove idiom.::The lambda can take a `char*` though. ::Ah, I see... `std::remove_if` _mutates_ the underlying collection and returns an iterator pointing to the end of the new list, and `vector::erase` causes the vector to be resized. very confusing :( but i guess it's correct.::Yeah, we can update the API for configuring these for both win and macos. How about I do that in a followup PR? Mainly to keep the changes separate.::Yeah, will change it to just `Init`.::💡 Yeah, should use `UTF16ToUTF8` here.::Done. 👍 ::It's possible that crashpad will start after the renderer processes have started, so it cannot be a command line arg. @zcbenz can probably answer better.::This confuses me too, in theory using pipes requires explicit allowance from sandbox, and it does in our case. It is probably because Chrome organizes crashpad code into `chrome_elf.dll` and then access to the named pipe come from the same module instead of different processes. We can do the same in Electron but it would be another refactoring and should probably be done in a separate PR.::Yeah, it is especially true in our own tests, as the crashReporter in main process is only started after the renderer process has landed related tests.::No, not needed.  I needed it during the process of making changes, but it's not needed anymore. Will revert it.::Chrome uses `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId` to check if the PID passed via pipe is actually the process connecting the pipe. However there may be multiple processes connecting the pipe and `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId` only returns the first PID, which ends up with the check here. The PID returned by `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId` is only used for the check here, it does not affect other parts. I guess Chrome does not have this problem because they put crashReporter code in `chrome_elf.dll`.::I'll add a method in `InspectableWebContents` so we can avoid all V8 related code.::Not a necessary change for this PR but can lazy construct this with `base::NoDestructor`::style nit: as a follow up, cleanup these variables to be private.::Interesting that this doesn't require a blocking scope, `base::PathService::Get` makes blocking calls and couldn't be called directly on main runner.::Hm, I'm not sure I understand how putting the code in a different dll would affect the order of processes that connect to the pipe or the process IDs returned by `GetNamedPipeClientProcessId`. Could you expand on the `chrome_elf.dll` theory?::Hmm, I'm not sure how `chrome_elf.dll` would play into that. If you load a dll in two separate processes, it's still two separate processes... Does Chrome set up crashpad before the sandbox is engaged?::Hmm, IMO we should change our API such that crashpad is always initialized in the main process and always before renderer processes are started (as in Chrome) (but given this patch is intended for backporting to 6-0-x, that would be a followup change)::It seems that they set it up before sandbox: https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/chrome/app/chrome_main_delegate.cc?type=cs&q=v8_crashpad_support&sq=package:chromium&g=0&l=645 That should explain the difference on the behavior.::Use `kRunAsNode` (currently only defined in `atom/app`, we should move it into `atom/common`)::It is a wild guess, I don't really understand why this check passes in Chromium.::We need to give users a chance to setup product name, crash server URL, etc. and it can not be done after the crash reporter is started. CEF works around it by reading crash reporter settings from an INI config file, we can probably do the same by reading from `package.json`. And yeah it should be a followup change.::How does this interact with the [`upload_parameters_` dictionary](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/18483/files#diff-e2f601f3e76bb760d9fc3a52faa7a098R59)?

Specifically, current versions of JAWS processes text inserted events in virtual cursor mode but not in focus mode. This may change in future versions of JAWS, and so at some point the live region changed events may truly become redundant with the text inserted events. ``` The change Initially landed in M71 and has been backported to M70, but not M69. #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

This PR ameliorates an issue whereby `minimizable` and `closable` weren't respected in `customButtonsOnHover` mode. `maximizable` isn't addressable here, since it's been blanket disabled in newer versions of macOS owing to an issue with the `NSWindowStyleMaskFullSizeContentView` style mask. That will, however, be addressed in the relevant backport pull request. This can be backported to 6 as-is but will need to be manually backported to 5 & 4 to account for the `maximizable` consideration. cc @pronebird @MarshallOfSound @nornagon @miniak #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,17833,jefgen/add-ICU-support-for-Reiwa-to-4-1-x::4-1-x,0,merged,,"#### Description of Change This change backports changes from the upstream ICU project's maintenance release for ICU 62.2 in order to enable support for the new Japanese Era ""Reiwa"" in Chromium 69 (which uses ICU version 62.1). Upstream release: http://site.icu-project.org/download/62 Background information: > The current Japanese Emperor will abdicate on April 30, 2019. The current era Heisei (平成) will end on that date, and a new Japanese era Reiwa (令和) will start on May 1, 2019. Until the end of April, the year in Japanese calendar is Heisei 31 (平成31年), but from May 1 on it will be changed to Reiwa 1 (令和元年). > > Existing ICU versions support Japanese calendar date calculation and formatting, but the new era Reiwa was not known when these versions were released. Therefore, these ICU versions produce an incorrect year format when using the Japanese calendar, which is the default calendar for the Japanese locale. This PR removes the patch for the ""placeholder"" era name support that was added in PR #17518, and replaces it with a new patch that adds support for the official new era name, and bumps the ICU version from 62.1 to 62.2. With this change you now get correct results for various JavaScript date/time formatting APIs for the Japanese calendar. Additionally, this PR also backports some additional bug fixes from upstream as well. This PR also includes the following fixes/updates: - Update IANA time zone data to tzdata2019a. - Japanese calendar: era calculation should use local time, not UTC. - Japanese calendar: use all valid eras for calendar calculations. - Fix LocalMemory move constructor deletion issue. This change requires re-generating the checked-in Chromium ICU data files (ex: icudtl.dat) in order for them to have the updated data for the new era name. Note: All of the checked-in files are be regenerated, even though the Electron project only uses the ""common"" one. Screenshots: Before, with the placeholder era not enabled. (Incorrectly showing dates after May 1 2019 using the Heisei era). ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29107334/56255339-5e3ee400-6079-11e9-9706-b6ddf1009add.png) After, correctly using the new era Reiwa for dates after April 30, 2019. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29107334/56255400-93e3cd00-6079-11e9-9853-3526c331d12f.png) You can also see the version bump for `icu` and `tz` in the screenshot.

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,17518,jefgen/backport-ICU-JaEra-to-4-1-x::4-1-x,0,merged,,"#### Description of Change This change backports changes from the upstream ICU 62.1 maintenance branch into the Chromium copy of ICU, in order to enable the ""placeholder era"" for the upcoming new Japanese Era. Upstream change: https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/pull/514 Upstream ticket: https://unicode-org.atlassian.net/browse/ICU-20482 With this change you can set/define an Environment Variable named `ICU_ENABLE_TENTATIVE_ERA` to `true` which will enable the placeholder era name. Notes on the changes: - This change required re-generating the checked-in Chromium ICU data files (ex: `icudtl.dat`) in order to update them with the new data for the placeholder era name. (This is why the .patch file is so large and contains binary diffs.) - The Chromium ICU folder under `third_party` is a separate git repo, so this required added a new folder named `icu` to the `electron\patches\common` folder (since there are currently no existing patches for ICU) - Also included in this change are some minor changes to the scripts used by Chromium for building the data files so that they actually work on Ubuntu. CC: @alexeykuzmin (also FYI for @aandrejs). Here's a simple example showing the results of the change: Before: ![before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29107334/54851606-bb788d00-4ca7-11e9-892e-fd67cefbaef4.png) After: ![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29107334/54851611-bd425080-4ca7-11e9-9c94-9ea30099564e.png) (Note the use of ""ＱＱ"" instead of the ""平成"" for the date format for ja-JP). Sample code used for testing: ```html <p>Outputs:</p> <form> <textarea id=""jaEraOutputs"" rows=""9"" cols=""60""></textarea> </form> <script type=""text/javascript""> // Heisi Era will end on April 30, 2019 so pick a date before. var dateHeisi = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 01, 15, 3, 0, 0)); // New Era starts on May 1, 2019. var dateNew = new Date(Date.UTC(2019, 05, 02, 3, 0, 0)); var out = document.getElementById(""jaEraOutputs""); out.value = """"; out.value += ""Heisi: \n""; out.value += ""\t ja-JP:  "" + dateHeisi.toLocaleString('ja-JP-u-ca-japanese', {era: 'long'}) + ""\n""; out.value += ""\t en-US:  "" + dateHeisi.toLocaleString('en-US-u-ca-japanese', {era: 'long'}) + ""\n""; out.value += ""\n""; out.value += ""New Era: \n""; out.value += ""\t ja-JP:  "" + dateNew.toLocaleString('ja-JP-u-ca-japanese', {era: 'long'}) + ""\n""; out.value += ""\t en-US:  "" + dateNew.toLocaleString('en-US-u-ca-japanese', {era: 'long'}) + ""\n""; </script> ``` #### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

This seems like a potential issue if this somehow became non-empty::should we do something else with this event?::this should perhaps go in the `atom` namespace? otherwise, it should have a comment about why it isn't::Did we update the docs for this? We should probably continue to support the old API as deprecated for 5-0-x::can we really get rid of all this stuff? that's great!::can we instead switch to using [beginSheetModalForWindow:completionHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsalert/1524296-beginsheetmodalforwindow?language=objc)? here and below::can we remove this now?::please note that this is a backport::oh you did :)::@nornagon There is a separate PR to deprecate the current API in `5-0-x`::https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/16801::`network::ResourceRequestBody` got typemapped in https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1395977 , which helped us get rid off these manual conversions. Side note: mojom typemaps are really cool feature :)::The change got landed in 74 https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1436036::Yup that seems like the alternative, can we change this as a follow up ?

When a window is opened with window.open to navigate to a cross-site destination, the new site instance should belong to the browsing instance of the opener window in order not to break scripting relationships between windows. fixes #8100. This change turns Chromium's site isolation on and depends on it being on in order to work properly. Turning on site isolation revealed the following latent problems that are / will be fixed also in this PR: - [X] If a cross-site redirection happens during a navigation, the renderer process that will handle the final URL will be locked to the pre-redirection URL with Chromium's child process security. If the page tries to access local resources, Chromium will refuse and kill the renderer process. - [X] Chromium now kills renderer processes that attempt to access resources for which they have no permissions. This means that the ""custom non standard schemes cannot access localStorage"" UT had to be adapted. The fix also requires the following to be addressed: - [x] If a cross-site redirection happens during a navigation, Chromium discards the speculative RFH that was created for the pre-redirection URL. This is harmless in Chromium but Electron reacts by asynchronously closing the associated BrowserWindow. User sees the new window navigating to the final URL and then being closed. #### Checklist - [x] PR description included and stakeholders cc'd - [x] `npm test` passes - [x] tests are [changed or added](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/testing.md) - [x] PR title follows semantic [commit guidelines](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/development/pull-requests.md#commit-message-guidelines) #### Release Notes <!-- Used to describe release notes for future release versions.

Please provide a description above and review the requirements below.

My main answer to this question is I don't think it matters because we we won't be shipping supported minor releases for the forseeable future -- we have to catch the majors up with upstream first. My default answer is 'yes we should have betas' because it's risky to ship code that hasn't been user-tested. We should reconsider this if/when a supported minor comes up, since by that time maybe the nightly builds will mitigate that risk. > Allowing only ""safe"" features to minor releases can be a good alternative.

We can't just use `//third_party/electron_node`, because that will result modules being built using the headers from `deps/v8`, instead of those in `//v8`. This target builds a hybrid header dir combining nodejs's headers and those of its non-v8 dependencies, combined with the v8 headers from chromium's v8. To build the headers: ```sh $ ninja -C out/Default electron/build/node:headers ``` This will produce a directory in `out/Default/gen/node_headers` containing the hybrid headers. You can pass this directory as `nodedir` to `npm rebuild`. The files in the lists are taken from the files that nodejs generates in its `install` step: ```sh node$ HEADERS_ONLY=1 python tools/install.py install foo / node$ find -s foo -type f -not -path '*openssl*' ``` (with the notable addition of backporting https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20925, which adds some headers that were accidentally missing in node v10.2.0) ##### Checklist <!-- Remove items that do not apply.

Adds support for running the 32-bit and 64-bit AppVeyor release builds as separate builds.  The builds have already been split into separate builds, but the release process needs to be updated to accommodate this change. 2. The upload script (`script/upload.py`) used by the release process was using an old python module to get the release information from GitHub.  It also used this module to create the release if it didn't exist.  This release creation isn't necessary anymore as `script/prepare-release.js` does this work.  Also, in the last couple of releases, there was an issue where this ended up creating extra releases and uploading the files to the wrong release.  This PR changes to use a new node script `script/find-release.js` to find the release instead. <!-- Thank you for your Pull Request.

If Node caches `require(foo)` calls s.t. `if (remoteModules.has(module)) return require(modules)` is cheap, why preload anything at all in `loadedModules`? OTOH if this setup exists because `require(foo)` still has some nonzero cost, why not make `loadedModules` a lazy-populated map that caches previous `require(foo)` calls? ::_(minor)_ if this clause is true then we don't need to look for `CONTEXT_ARG` in argv at all, so that work should go into an `} else { ... ` block after this block::I agree with @miniak and @MarshallOfSound that this is a [""read any file plz""](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/12877#discussion_r187762273) API. The consensus in the `master` PR seems to have been ""address that in a followup change"" but that's not been written yet so what we're doing here is proposing only the risky bits for a bugfix-only stable release. I see the value in fixing https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/12316 for sandboxed mode, but this seems like a risky fix. Maybe we should wait for this to finish baking in `master`, then backport it to a future 2-0-x release::> If Node caches require(foo) calls s.t. if (remoteModules.has(module)) return require(modules) is cheap, why preload anything at all in loadedModules? This is a browserify `require` and browserify can only bundle modules specified as string literals. > OTOH if this setup exists because require(foo) still has some nonzero cost, why not make loadedModules a lazy-populated map that caches previous require(foo) calls? As I said above, it is not about the cost, but I can change it so it returns from loadedModules directly::As I said in previous comments, there's no new risk being introduced here, because renderers currently have unfiltered access to the full range of Electron IPC messages. That means if some code can do IPC, it can do anything such as loading modules remotely and calling arbitrary functions. Even if I make this change now it won't have any benefit for the reason stated above: Untrusted code can still invoke any function remotely. OTOH I will have to test more scenarios since taking the preloadPath from webPreferences is not guaranteed to work for every webContents (think of windows created with window.open). This is why I wanted to make another PR for changing the preload path behavior: It is a refactoring change that doesn't have much to do with the bugfix being addressed here.::In case it was not clear, the ""read any file plz"" API is already available through the IPC messages that implement `electron.remote` (as well as ""write/delete any file plz"" APIs, since it is all available through electron.remote.fs)::I don't have a strong opinion on whether to lazy-cache these in `loadedModules`. My uninformed guess is that it would be faster than re-requiring a module but I don't know how often we'll hit that use case. However, I'm still interested in understanding this patch better -- what's the criteria for putting a module in `loadedModules` vs `remoteModules`? That is, how to decide which modules to preload and which to lazy-load?::`remoteModules` are modules which are proxies to node.js modules in the browser process. We do this because the browserify-provided shims for some modules (child_process, os, fs and path) are not ideal for Electron apps. Here's how browserify is invoked by Electron build system: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/electron.gyp#L513-L519 These arguments provide replacements for browserify shims, but they also cause electron's `remote` module to be loaded, which is what we want to avoid in early startup for sandbox `loadedModules` are browserify shims that are already available in the renderer process, so it is possible for an Electron app to create a preload bundle and pass `-e` to exclude from their own bundle, and the `require` will work since it is provided by `loadedModules`.::these things should have been discussed in the original PR. this is a backport.::",931cb295fadf8e4a54f22972b05bade0548699f1::

(Like changing default locations for Chromium dirs.) The DCHECK here https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/11396/files#diff-85bd8d8e80263b8547de573fd87cb532R532 fails with being called on invalid thread instead of main thread otherwise. Any ideas on how to fix it ? Also the thread task runner we try to obtain on the `JavaScriptEnvironment` initialization will be a difference one in that case.::That's a surprise to me, it is impossible for `App` to be initialized on threads other than UI thread, is it because the `BrowserThread` class has not been initialized by the time the Node.js modules are loaded? Regarding the task runner, by the time of `JavaScriptEnvironment`'s initialization, there is no thread task runner available, I used `BridgeTaskRunner` to workaround it.::Yup, the main thread is initialized only in [BrowserMainLoop::MainMessageLoopStart](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/content/browser/browser_main_runner.cc?sq=package:chromium&l=107) , while the node modules are loaded early on because of `PostEarlyInitialization` hook. I am not sure of the best way to fix this and at the same time not cause any performance issue.::I think we can just remove the `DCHECK_CURRENTLY_ON` in `App:App`.::Cool but is it ok for the app module to be initialized on a different thread that UI ?::I don't think the module is initialized on other threads, the DCHECK failed because the `BrowserThread` class is not initialized, not because `App` is initialized on other threads.::👍 ::Even if I remove the DCHECK on app module, I hit the DCHECK in [BrowserChildProcessObserver::Add](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/atom/browser/api/atom_api_app.cc#L535) ``` [36149:1222/174140.514620:FATAL:browser_child_process_host_impl.cc(133)] Check failed: ::content::BrowserThread::CurrentlyOn(BrowserThread::UI).

https://api.github.com/repos/electron/electron,6986,arm-release-asset-name::master,1,merged,,This pull requests adds the `v7l` suffix to ARM build release assets so they can eventually be disambiguated from future `armv6l` and `arm64` assets that may be produced. This mirrors the ARM build names that node uses: https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.5.0/ ### Example - Old name: `electron-v1.3.4-linux-arm.zip` - New name: `electron-v1.3.4-linux-armv7l.zip` This will be backported to all 1.0+ releases but no old assets will be deleted.
