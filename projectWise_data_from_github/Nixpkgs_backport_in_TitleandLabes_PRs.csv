It backports [Cython 3.0 trashcan support](https://github.com/cython/cython/pull/2842) to Cython 0.X. This patch does not affect Python code unless the code explicitly uses the feature, which is both an argument for patching the global Cython (it's fairly safe) and for making sage use a modified Cython, since only a modified cypari2 will use this change. Just let me know if applying the patch globally is a bad idea, I won't be offended :) In fact, I didn't run nixpkgs-review because it rebuilds everything that uses Python. (I can also just work around the Sage test failure instead of applying the patch at all, but users can still sporadically hit the problem during normal use.) cc @omasanori @timokau This is causing the totallyreal.pyx aarch64 failure in the dependency update PR, I believe. - [ ] Tested using sandboxing ([nix.useSandbox](https://nixos.org/nixos/manual/options.html#opt-nix.useSandbox) on NixOS, or option `sandbox` in [`nix.conf`](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-conf-file) on non-NixOS linux) - Built on platform(s) - [x] NixOS - [ ] macOS - [ ] other Linux distributions - [ ] Tested via one or more NixOS test(s) if existing and applicable for the change (look inside [nixos/tests](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/tests)) - [ ] Tested compilation of all pkgs that depend on this change using `nix-shell -p nixpkgs-review --run ""nixpkgs-review wip""` - [ ] Tested execution of all binary files (usually in `./result/bin/`) - [ ] Determined the impact on package closure size (by running `nix path-info -S` before and after) - [ ] Ensured that relevant documentation is up to date - [x] Fits [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). ::",e69d0a0aa3bf12c5ed2790df1e6bf25eeb53202d::7d1d7848e9f5e47081c71692687ec18e6d9501fc::

The intended use-case is to support users who want to disable test suites, benchmarks, haddocks, etc. for the Haskell dependencies, but re-enable them for the packages within the final shell. This can be useful when developing a complex local package with lots of overrides; building the package set can be prohibitively complex when having to override lots of test dependency breakage, but one would still want to run the test/benchmark suite of the _local_ package (and thus have Nix pull down all of _its_ dependencies into the shell). ###### Things done Cherry picked 335f1fb25f2f784e496dc4e5560cea7e3414a7a8 and 95d0e6c1b8adca3a03c5e79fc1dba84b5c1f68d6 from the main branch onto the `release-20.09` branch.

A [quick scan of the first 10 pages](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+label%3A%228.has%3A+port+to+stable%22) suggests that more than 90% of the time they are used like proposed; The backport PR doesn't receive any additional labels. I'd also prefer it that way. There is no need to keep track of the state of a backport PR and at the same time it is important to have two bits of information on PRs to unstable. One to indicate that it needs to be backported and the second to distinguish those that got successfully backported from those that accidentally didn't receive the first label.::",073ddd892eb354d77902e3a6b5d6dcb5aa02eeca::

NOTE: The generated HTML file implicitly depend on reveal.js (and I see no good way to bundle it with Nix). Either provide reveal.js in a local path next to the generated HTML file[1], or override the revealjsdir attribute, for example by pointing to an URL (can also be a path): asciidoctor-revealjs -a revealjsdir=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js@3.9.2 presentation.adoc Implementation details: 1. Added ""gem 'asciidoctor-revealjs'"" to the Gemfile. 2. Ran ""nix-shell -p bundler --run 'bundle lock --update'"" from pkgs/tools/typesetting/asciidoctor/. 3. Hand edited Gemfile.lock to remove all but the asciidoctor-revealjs changes. (Rationale: allow backporting to release-20.09.) 4. Finish off with ""nix-shell -p bundix --run 'bundix'"". [1] Of course Nix can help with _that_, but that's external to the asciidoctor-revealjs program.

Upstream PR (merged): https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/10422 Modifications: - spl_kvmalloc does not exists in zfs 0.8.4 - related code was dropped. ###### Motivation for this change I am trying to build a 5.8 kernel and zfs did not build. There is an upstream PR that added a thin define around `__vmalloc` to support both the old and new interface. This will probably turn into an issue once 5.8 is released and promoted from `linuxPackages_testing`. ###### Things done I have build a small nixos iso image with this nixpkgs version and successfully created a zfs backed mount with the updated kernel package (kernel 5.4.54).

Also added some warnings to advertise the use of `pkgs.element*` and to mention removed feature-flags (where the features are now available by default in `element`). Rationale for backport: for the matrix subsystem on NixOS we've established a backport-by-default policy to remain up-to-date with the `matrix.org` infrastructure several months ago (previosuly we experienced compat-issues with their infrastructure occasionally). Several people (including me) from the Nix-matrix channel are already using `element-web` at `1.7` on NixOS systems (on both unstable and 20.03) without having any issues (while using and while migrating to it), so we currently consider this backport as doable. cc @NixOS/backports @claudiiii ###### Things done <!-- Please check what applies.

https://api.github.com/repos/NixOS/nixpkgs,82831,tailscale-19.09::release-19.09,0,merged,10.rebuild-darwin: 101-500::10.rebuild-linux: 101-500::6.topic: golang::6.topic: nixos::8.has: module (update)::8.has: package (new)::,"###### Motivation for this change Tailscale is a new package+nixos module, merged recently in master. I would like to backport it to 19.09, selfishly so that I can install Tailscale on my NixOS servers. It's not clear if this is okay or not. I backported the pppd module I created into 19.09 late last year, and back then the reasoning was: it's a ""leaf"" config, so it only risks breaking something if you explicitly decide to enable it. Therefore the risk was low to other 19.09 users. I think the same reasoning applies here: the tailscale package is a ""leaf"" package that creates binaries (not libs), and the nixos module does nothing unless you explicitly opt-in. So, this should be completely safe to backport. The only policy I could find was in the NixOS manual, where it says RMs decide what bugs & features should be backported. So, @disassembler and @lheckemann, I think this is your decision. There are 4 commits in this PR: 3 cherrypicks, and 1 19.09-only change. 1. Cherrypick https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/c5733e7a0933b62144e17947176ebd2e871b4616 to fix `buildGo113Module` (otherwise it can't build anything) 2. Cherrypick https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/6e055c9f4a3734e1d1b8e9f55be68e6743bf59d3 (tailscale pkg+module init) 3. Cherrypick https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/1e593070cdd8953f2c4f661535684d7aa8783441 (pkg version bump to fix a severe bug) 4. Change the pkg to use `buildGo113Module` instead of `buildGoModule`, because 19.09 defaults to Go 1.12 and Tailscale requires >=1.13. Of note: even though `buildGo113Module` exists in 19.09, this would be the 1st and only package that uses it in 19.09 (that's why it was broken without anyone noticing). So, um, there. That's all the information on this change. Hopefully that helps you decide if this is acceptable to backport or not. I would like to document some general guidelines for this for future maintainers (because nobody was sure if this is okay or not), so I anxiously await your feedback :) ###### Things done - [ ] Tested using sandboxing ([nix.useSandbox](http://nixos.org/nixos/manual/options.html#opt-nix.useSandbox) on NixOS, or option `sandbox` in [`nix.conf`](http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#sec-conf-file) on non-NixOS linux) - Built on platform(s) - [ ] NixOS - [ ] macOS - [x] other Linux distributions - [ ] Tested via one or more NixOS test(s) if existing and applicable for the change (look inside [nixos/tests](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/nixos/tests)) - [x] Tested compilation of all pkgs that depend on this change using `nix-shell -p nixpkgs-review --run ""nixpkgs-review wip""` - [x] Tested execution of all binary files (usually in `./result/bin/`) - [ ] Determined the impact on package closure size (by running `nix path-info -S` before and after) - [ ] Ensured that relevant documentation is up to date - [x] Fits [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). ::",0e1cf19043e1de969d3f01db70173dbe982b27d6::dd9a49399ea0e0fc06827e3fa3248a4eab11c396::65ff63723ec8236a021358036dbf26f0acb78bfb::75569aa6e4b43f26caaf09aca4340471c4273b15::609a3da59e6491ea923e7a8aa25d946483d248ae::

However, just flagging that this will be a problem for future releases. Upstream, I'm about to mark 0.97-40 as stable, which will be the version number burned into the binaries. `v0.97` doesn't appear anywhere in the software itself. Fortunately, Nix itself doesn't care about the version number, so I'm happy with whatever is acceptable to nixpkgs for now, until we get to a release that's unrepresentable.::(as I tried to explain on IRC, the versioning logic of the tailscale repo is currently a bit broken, and the version names are based on the state of the non-OSS repo. So even though the code itself is all open, the releases end up pointing to an opaque commit hash right now. I'm working on fixing that so that OSS build versions are entirely based on the OSS tree, but it's not done yet. So, just a heads up that the versioning for this package will change in the future, once all this is fixed upstream)::```suggestion version = ""0.97""; src = fetchFromGitHub { owner = ""tailscale""; repo = ""tailscale""; rev = ""v${version}""; ``` nixpkgs manual says version shouldn't have that character in it.

I had assumed that the `store-path-to-layer.sh` was only ever passed a single store path, but that is not the case if there are multiple packages going into the final layer. To fix this, we loop through the paths going into the final layer, appending them to the tar file and making sure they end up at the right path. <!-- Nixpkgs has a lot of new incoming Pull Requests, but not enough people to review this constant stream.

IMO it makes sense to backport this since 20.03 is still in the ""alpha"" stage, to have a consistent behavior on 20.03 and nixos-unstable, and as I already updated the Wiki page: https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Backlight#brightnessctl. But if anyone has objections we can close this, it's completely optional (both methods work). cc @flokli ###### Things done <!-- Please check what applies.

This patch is based on https://hg.python.org/cpython/rev/c16063765d3a but because the code around is different there are some changes (C-strings instead of Python objects etc.) With this patch Tensorflow builds successfully on many-core machine. ###### Things done <!-- Please check what applies.

Fixed since python 3.4. It makes pyc creation atomic, preventing a race condition. The patch has been rebased on our deterministic build patch. It wasn't backported to python 2.7 because there was a complaint about changed semantics. Since files are now created in a temporary directory and then moved, symlinks will be overridden. See https://bugs.python.org/issue17222. That is an edge-case however. Ubuntu and debian have backported the fix in 2013 already, making it mainstream enough for us to adopt. CC @FRidh. I became aware of this bug while trying to build the py2 version of tensorflow from source with 12 build cores (https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/63616).

You can try building the memtest86-efi command with the following, as long as you have this PR checked out: ```console $ nix-build -A memtest86-efi ``` You can test installing the memtest86 EFI app with the following nixos setting: ```nix { config, pkgs, ...}: { boot.loader.systemd-boot.memtest86.enable = true; } ``` Although you need to be using `systemd-boot` for this to work. Also, you need `allowUnfree` set to `true` for both of these to work. Pinging @c0bw3b and @JohnAZoidberg since they were nice enough to do reviews for the above PRs.  Also pinging @Lassulus and @matthewbauer since they merged in the above PRs. ###### Things done <!-- Please check what applies.

At work we are following the release-19.03 branch, so it would be helpful for us if this PR got in 19.03 to work around the long build-times caused by this bug. (cherry picked from commit 0698b5438bdbed31786fe883332408583f8e6535) Pinging @peti. I guess I should also ping the release manager for 19.03, but I don't remember who it is.

I don't think there is a good reason *not* to add this alias.  I don't think adding an alias will break anyone's configuration? Well, unless someone is already using the `powerManagment.cpufreq.governor` module name in one of their private configs?  Maybe we want to be extra careful and make sure not to break this? Although thinking about this, this should be similar to adding adding new configuration options (like `powerManagement.cpufreq.max` and `powerManagement.cpufreq.min`).  I guess there isn't a huge difference between adding an alias and adding a new configuration option. So I guess I am for adding the `powerManagement.cpufreq.governor` alias so that people can update their configurations while still using 18.09 in preparation for 19.03.::",0232f5cb2d620bff140096580568d3e72afd1964::

Patches were pulled from H.J. Lu's backport branch to 4.9 (hjl/indirect/gcc-4_9-branch), available at https://github.com/hjl-tools/gcc/tree/hjl/indirect/gcc-4_9-branch/master. Upstream GCC does not apply patches to anything older than the gcc-6-branch. H.J. Lu is the author of the upstream retpoline commits as well. Several Linux distributions already backported these patches to GCC 4 branches and some old kernels (3.13 for instance) have been recompiled with these GCC patches. These kernels only allow to load kernel modules that are compiled with the retpoline support.

Note: it's unclear why `dontPatchELF` is now necessary for the build to pass (on my end, at any rate) but it doesn't make much sense to run this fixup anyway, Note: my reading of xen's INSTALL suggests that --with-system-ovmf should point directly to the OVMF binary.
