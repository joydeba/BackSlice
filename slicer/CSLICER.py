        Adapt the sourceOriginal to a stable version based on various inputs.

        Parameters:
            astdiffsHistory (list): A list of tuples where each tuple contains (commit_a, commit_b, list(diff)).
            context (str): The context code of the sourceOriginal in string form.
            dependencies (list): A list of new dependency changes for sourceOriginal.
            metadata (tuple): Metadata of a pull request, including (title, body, tags, comments).
            functionalSet (set): A set of function names covered by test cases.
            compilationSet (set): A set of functions in sourceOriginal referenced by functionalSet.
            stableLibraris (dict): Library information in the form of {dir_item['name']: {
                'libraries': list(set(libraries)),
                'function_names': list(set(function_names)),

            targetfile (str): A string representation of the target source file.

        Returns:
            str: The adapted source code, close to sourcebackport.
